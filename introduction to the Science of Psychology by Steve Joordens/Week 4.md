### Phantom limb

A phantom limb is the sensation that an amputated or missing limb is still attached. Approximately 60 to 80% of individuals with an amputation experience phantom sensations in their amputated limb, and the majority of the sensations are painful. Phantom sensations may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome).

早在16世纪，法国的外科医生巴雷（Ambroise Pare）已经注意到幻肢的存在，关于幻肢的民间传说也不胜枚举。“幻肢”这个名词的则是费城著名的神经科医生维米奇尔在1872年开始始用。他观察美国南北战争后在士兵身上广泛发生的幻肢现象，并用假名在当时流行的通俗杂志《Lippincott's Journal》发表幻肢的第一篇文章。

五到八成的截肢患者会在其截去部位经受幻肢的现象，幻肢和幻肢痛也可能出现在失去四肢以外的部位，如乳房、牙齿、眼睛、阴茎、鼻、脸，甚至腹腔内的子宫、阑尾等，都有个案报导。

幻肢也会出现在天生没有四肢的人或是瘫痪的病患。 约一半的幻肢病人有令人无法忍受的幻肢痛。患部在切除前若经受长期的不舒服，幻肢痛发生的情形较多。幻肢痛可能会因为压力、焦虑或天气变化而加重，或因忙碌、按摩残肢而减轻。幻肢也会有其他感受如热、冷、痒、挤压或炙热感。幻肢有时候会比正常的肢体短，或是以错置、令人不舒服的姿势扭曲。约有三分之一的病人其幻肢无法动.

### retina

视网膜（retina）居于眼球壁的内层，是一层透明的薄膜。视网膜由色素上皮层和视网膜感觉层组成，两层间在病理情况下可分开，称为视网膜脱离。色素上皮层与脉络膜紧密相连，由色素上皮细胞组成，它们具有支持和营养光感受器细胞、遮光、散热以及再生和修复等作用。
视信息在视网膜上形成视觉神经冲动，沿视路将视信息传递到视中枢形成视觉，这样在我们的头脑中建立起图像。

### Retina bipolar cell

<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bdEez.jpg">

As a part of the retina, bipolar cells exist between photoreceptors (rod cells and cone cells) and ganglion cells. They act, directly or indirectly, to transmit signals from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells.

Bipolar cells are so-named as they have a central body from which two sets of processes arise. They can synapse with either rods or cones (rod/cone mixed input BCs have been found in teleost fish but not mammals), and they also accept synapses from horizontal cells. The bipolar cells then transmit the signals from the photoreceptors or the horizontal cells, and pass it on to the ganglion cells directly or indirectly (via amacrine cells). Unlike most neurons, bipolar cells communicate via graded potentials, rather than action potentials.

### ganglion cells

Ganglion cells are a type of neuron located near the inner surface of the retina and are the final output neurons of the vertebrate retina. Ganglion cells collect visual information in their dendrites from bipolar cells and amacrine cells and transmit it to the brain through out their axon to the brain. Retinal ganglion cells vary significantly in terms of their size, connections, and responses to visual stimulation. Based on their projections and functions, there are at least five main classes of retinal ganglion cells: Parasol (Magnocellular, or M pathway). Midget (Parvocellular, or P pathway). Bistratified (Koniocellular, or K pathway). Photosensitive ganglion cells (melanopsin ganglion cells). Ganglion cells projecting to the Superior Colliculus for eye movements (saccades).

神经节细胞（视网膜的）ganglion cell 位于视网膜最终段的神经细胞，其轴索为视神经纤维，纤维在眼球内，分布于网膜的表面，集于视束（视神经）乳头，由眼球出来之后，经过视束交叉，止于外侧膝状体。此神经节细胞的受纳区域，多种动物都大致呈圆形，对其中心用光照射，峰值放电出现在照射开始（on反应）；照射周边则在照射终止之后（off反应）；如果再照射其中间时，将出现光照射的两时期（on－off反应）。但这种性质并不是固定的，由于动物不同、波长不同，以及明暗适应的情况不同，而有很大的变化。



### Iris & Pupil

<img src="https://www.visionweb.com/vwweb/images/content/consumers/illustrations/about%20the%20eye_anatomy_iris.jpg">

Behind the cornea is the iris, the colored part of the eye. The iris acts as a diaphragm, like a shutter on a camera, regulating the amount of light that enters through the pupil. The pupil appears as a black hole at the center of the iris. It is the opening through which light enters the eye. Some iris muscles contract to enlarge the pupil when more light is needed; others reduce it when there is too much light, to protect the inside of the eye. The pupil dilates and constricts in response to changes in lighting but excitement, attractive sights and some drugs also have this effect.

The amount of pigment in the iris determines the color of the eye. Blue eyes have the least amount of pigment, while brown eyes have the most. The random patterns on the iris are unique to each individual. Each person has a distinct pattern of filaments, pits and striations. Infants' eyes often change color as they become toddlers but from this age forward, the iris color and pattern is stable throughout life.

The iris is protected from external elements by the cornea. It is nourished and cushioned by the aqueous humor, which is produced by and flows from within the iris.

虹膜属于眼球中层，位于血管膜的最前部，在睫状体前方，可调节瞳孔的大小，调节进入眼内光线多少的作用。虹膜中央有瞳孔。在马、牛瞳孔的边缘上有虹膜粒。

瞳孔，是动物或人眼睛内虹膜中心的小圆孔，为光线进入眼睛的通道。虹膜上瞳孔括约肌的收缩可以使瞳孔缩小，瞳孔开大肌的收缩使瞳孔散大，瞳孔的开大与缩小控制进入瞳孔的光量。

### Afterimage

An afterimage is an image that continues to appear in one's vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased. An afterimage may be a normal phenomenon (physiological afterimage) or may be pathological (palinopsia). Illusory palinopsia may be a pathological exaggeration of physiological afterimages. Afterimages occur because photochemical activity in the retina continues even when you are no longer experiencing the original stimulus. The remainder of this article refers to physiological afterimages. A common physiological afterimage is the dim area that seems to float before one's eyes after briefly looking into a light source, such as a camera flash. Afterimages are a common symptom of visual snow.

从生理学角度来讲，物体对视觉的刺激作用突然停止后，人的视觉感应井非立刻全部消失，而是该物的映像仍然暂时存留，这种现象称作‘视觉余像“。视觉余像分为正余像和负余像两类。视觉余像的形成，是眼睛连续注视的结果，是因为神经兴奋所留下的痕迹而引发的。当外界物体的视觉刺激作用停止以后，在眼睛视网膜上的影像感觉并不会立刻消失，这种视觉现象叫做视觉后像。视觉后像的发生，是由于神经兴奋所留下的痕迹作用，也称为视觉残像。
残像对影视技术与传播设计来说具有非常重大的意义。正由于视觉残像的作用，才使我们有幸欣赏电影与动画艺术。正由于残像作用，使我们能通过移动的狭缝看清隐蔽其后的形象，也就是实现形象的非同时拼接。这正是电视成像的根本原理。残像是视觉后效之一.

### Sensation and Perception

Sensation and perception are two separate processes that are very closely related. Sensation is input about the physical world obtained by our sensory receptors, and perception is the process by which the brain selects, organizes, and interprets these sensations. In other words, senses are the physiological basis of perception. Perception of the same senses may vary from one person to another because each person’s brain interprets stimuli differently based on that individual’s learning, memory, emotions, and expectations.  



### Gestalt psychology

Gestalt psychology or gestaltism  is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies.

一、Gestalt是什么？
词意为“形式”，但与我们说的形式的意义不完全相同，它揭示了人的感知，特别是占主要地位的视知觉，并不是直接的镜像反应，它能对所看到的的“形”（视觉、声音或触觉信息）进行选择、组织、加工，也就是阿恩海姆所说的“知觉本身具有一定的’思维’能力”，视知觉并不是对刺激物的被动重复，而是一种积极的理性活动。简言之，格式塔就是由知觉活动组织过经验中的整体。

二、Gestalt Psychology 5大规律
Gestalt Psychology 在研究人知觉的“思维能力”的过程中，发现了大量的知觉（主要是视觉）规律，尽管还没有哪种学说可以令人信服地解释这些规律背后的心理机制，但是作为非常稳定的现象和规律，它们可以常常被运用与设计中，主要的知觉规律包括完型论（整体论）、选择论、简化论、连续性、相似性。

三、Gestalt Psychology 的规律应用

1.完型论（整体论） : 完型论强调人们通过视知觉活动，将感知到的形态加以组织，形成经验中的整体，而非客体本身。  
2.选择论 : 积极的选择是视觉的基本特征。然而当图的轮廓出现不完整、未封闭、形状不规则、面积较大等图底关系不明确的情况下，就容易出现错觉中的“两难图形”，整个界面很难Don’t make me think。中国的传统国画在这方面做的很棒，国画中的白色为底，可以是湖水、可以是远山、可以是天际，可以是云海。这些元素具备了“底”的特质：“不完整”、“未封闭”、“形状不规则”、“面积较大”等。留白在被赋予各种各样的意义同时，在不影响“底”的表达情况下，增加了画面的意境。  
3.简化论 : 人们对一个复杂对象进行知觉时，只要没有特定的要求，就会常常倾向于把对象看作是有组织的简单的规则图形。  
4.连续性 : 如果一个图形的某些部分可以被看作是连接在一起的，那么这些部分就相对容易被我们知觉为一个整体。    
5.相似性 : 在整体论里已经提过：“刺激物的形状、大小、颜色、强度等物理属性方面比较相似时，这些刺激物就容易被组织起来而构成一个整体。”

### Visual Agnosia

Visual agnosia is the inability to recognize visually presented objects despite the preservation of elementary sensory functions. Visual agnosia is diagnosed by assessing the patient's ability to name, describe uses for, and pantomime the use of visually presented objects. Extensive occipital damage due to anoxic insult or severe infarction is the usual cause of this rare syndrome.144–146

Theoretically, there are two forms of visual agnosia: the “apperceptive” form that is caused by impaired visual processing that results in the poor perception of the object, and the “associative” form that is caused by disorders that affect the associative cortex and results in the correctly formed visual percepts being poorly matched with previously processed sensory data and recognition.147,148 Most patients with visual agnosia present with both aspects, although one type may predominate.

There appear to be multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that result in apperceptive visual agnosia. These may be related to the misperception of shapes due to defects in representing the elementary properties of curvature, surface and volume149 or failure to integrate multiple elements into a perceptual whole. Patients with severe apperceptive agnosia usually have extensive and diffuse occipital lesions and tend to have residual field defects.

Closely related to the associative form of visual agnosia is optic aphasia, in which patients are unable to name visually presented objects but otherwise show relatively intact knowledge about objects and are, thereby, able to categorize and demonstrate their use through pantomime.152,153 Visual agnosia and optic aphasia may simply represent a continuum with varying deficits in knowledge retrieval.154,155 Patients typically present with large left PCA territory infarction with right homonymous hemianopia.It has been suggested that there is a functional disconnection between visual perception and language systems.

视觉失认症是指患者不再能够依靠视觉来辨识或辨识不清以前曾是毫无困难就可以认出的的事情。这种视觉性的失认不是由于视力方面的问题导致的，也与患者的智能无关。

弗洛伊德是早期进行失认症研究的一批学者之一。失认症的名称Agnosia就是他于1891年首先倡导采用的。不过他除了开创了这个词汇以外，在知觉的神经心理研究方面，却没有多大贡献。 
对失认症的最为经典的早期探索是Lissauer(1890)进行的临床研究。Lissauer的主要贡献是对物体失认的症状进行了基本的划分。区分出脑损伤所导致的两种不同形式的认知障碍：一种认知障碍主要影响的是患者有意识地接受和分辨物体特性，从而导致对物体的认知困难；另一种认知障碍主要影响到患者怎样去评定主体所看到的内容，从而导致对物体的认知困难。Lissauer对失认症的这种两分法，以及关于失认的概念为日后人们对这种神经心理症状的深入研究起了一个良好的开端。 

对失认症的研究直到目前为止仍然是一个相对比较薄弱的方面。这有几方面的原因。一个最主要的原因是失认症在临床上并不多见。如果同言语障碍、记忆障碍等症状比较起来，其发病率的差别是相当大的。特别是比较典型或表现充分的失认症则更是不易见到。另一个原因与认知科学的研究传统有一定关系，结合当代认知理论对失认症进行的比较深入的研究也只是近年来才得以展开。

### prosopagnosia

While most of us are guilty of forgetting the name of someone we've met before, we're generally quite good at remembering faces, and certainly recognize close friends and family at a glance. For those with the neurological disorder known as prosopagnosia (also called face blindness), those loved ones can appear to be strangers. People with prosopagnosia cannot recognize familiar faces and often cannot distinguish among the faces of strangers. They may also have trouble recognizing familiar places or objects or seeing the difference between someone's face and another object. Some people with prosopagnosia even have difficulty recognizing themselves. Researchers estimate that one in 50 people may have some form of prosopagnosia.

Acquired prosopagnosia occurs in older men and women after a brain injury, stroke, or the onset of degenerative disease. Developmental prosopagnosia appears during childhood and may have genetic roots or be due to a prenatal or childhood brain abnormality or damage. Children on the autism spectrum often display some degree of prosopagnosia, which may account for their social limitations.

Since there is no cure for prosopagnosia, treatment focuses on the development of compensatory skills, such as looking for cues like unique physical characteristics or voice that will help them identify their own friends, family members, and acquaintances.  People with prosopagnosia may draw inspiration from successful people who have coped with the condition, such as Oliver Sacks and Chuck Close.

面部辨识能力缺乏症，又名面孔失忆症、面容失忆症，患者对别人的脸型失去辨认能力.

症状表现:  

1. 患者看不清别人的脸；
2. 患者对别人的脸型失去辨认能力

神经学专家对大脑如何感知面容的过程了解得还不全面，只知道从事这一工作的能力从一出生便具备，涉及大脑不同区域的广泛分布，或许反应面部对生存感知的重要性。同陌生人比起来，婴儿更喜欢看母亲的容貌，并能迅速学会如何区分男人和女人的脸。但在脸盲症患者中，那一神经路线的某些通道似乎被切断。大脑扫描显示他们的颞叶和枕骨脑叶都有损伤，而大脑的这两个区域就主要负责面部识别。

### capgras delusion

A person with Capgras syndrome irrationally believes that someone they know has been replaced by an imposter. In some cases, they may also believe pets or even inanimate objects are imposters.

Capgras syndrome is named after Joseph Capgras, a French psychiatrist who, with a colleague, first described the disorder in 1923. It is one of several conditions classified as delusional misidentification syndromes (DMSs).

Although this psychological condition can affect anyone, it is more common in women than men.

Capgras syndrome can be very disturbing for the person affected, as well as for their loved ones. So, it is important for people witnessing the syndrome to seek advice from a doctor.

1923年由法国的精神科医生卡普格拉（J．Capgras）首先描述，也称卡普格拉综合症（Capgras delusion），该症状通常由于视觉信息从梭状回到杏仁核到边缘系统的线路受损而产生。核心表现是患者认为一个现实的人（多数是亲属）被另外一个人所冒充或取代，这两个人同时都存在，而且长相和其他特征都是一样的，值得注意到是，通过电话联系患者还是可以辨认出来到（因为听觉信号到边缘系统的线路没有受损）。该症状在临床上比较罕见，一般被解释为精神分裂症患者。
该症状出现后患者具有高度的不安全感，较高比例的患者具有暴力倾向。

### Binocular Disparity

Binocular disparity occurs because of the difference between the retinal images of our eyes and how the differing signals influence the visual image perceived by our brain. Because we have two eyes, two slightly different signals are sent to the brain due to the slight discrepancies in the retinal image. You can see how binocular disparity occurs. 

The closer an object is to your eyes the more evident the disparity becomes. Hold a pencil arms length away from your face. The pencil looks normal and is sharp. Then slowly move the pencil closer to your face. As you get closer the pencil will become more blurry. This happens because of binocular disparity. 

The visual cortex in the brain uses a process called stereopsis to correct binocular disparity. The two differing signals are combined by the visual cortex and a perception of depth occurs. Depth perception begins to occur around four months of age by which time the visual cortex has developed.

双眼视差有时候也被称为立体视差（stereopsis），是一种深度线索。物体离观察者越近，两只眼睛所看到物体的差别也越大，这就形成了双眼视差。大脑可以利用对这种视差的测量，估计出物体到眼睛的距离。

双眼视差对知觉深度和距离具有重要意义。当物体的视像落在两眼网膜的对应部位时，人们看到单一的物体；当视像落在网膜的非对应部位而差别不大时，人们将看到深度和距离；两眼视差进一步加大，人们将看到双像。双眼深度线索随距离增加而变化，当距离超过1300米时，两眼视轴平行，双眼视差为零，对判断距离便不起作用了。

### Alice in Wonderland syndrome

Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a disorienting neuropsychological condition that affects perception. People experience size distortion such as micropsia, macropsia, pelopsia, or teleopsia. Size distortion may occur of other sensory modalities.

It is often associated with migraines, and the use of psychoactive drugs. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epstein–Barr virus (see mononucleosis). AiWS can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity causing abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture.

Anecdotal reports suggest that the symptoms are common in childhood, with many people growing out of them in their teens. It appears that AiWS is also a common experience at sleep onset, and has been known to commonly arise due to a lack of sleep.


爱丽丝梦游仙境症（Alice in Wonderland Syndrome，简称AIWS），又称“视微症”，属于一种罕见眼疾，是神经学上的一种高度迷惑性现象，以致影响到人类的视觉感知。其症候表现为：长时间观察一种事物，会突然像爱丽丝漫游仙境一样，周遭的事情忽然变大，或者忽然变小。病人有时候眼前会出现马赛克的视觉效果，有的患者则会出现时空扭曲感。

爱丽丝梦游仙境症状（AIWS），或者叫“视微症”，是神经学上的一种高度迷惑性现象，以致影响到人类的视觉感知。患者看其它物体时往往呈现不是真实的大小和深度。医生认为这种病症可能是由于大脑枕骨脑叶病变导致的，枕骨脑叶可控制视觉信息。此病可能发生在任何年龄，但更多地发生于儿童时期。患者有时会出现偏头痛，或者经常失眠等症状。是全球十大罕见怪病症之一。

### Cocktail party effect

The cocktail party effect is the phenomenon of the brain's ability to focus one's auditory attention (an effect of selective attention in the brain) on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli, as when a partygoer can focus on a single conversation in a noisy room. Listeners have the ability to both segregate different stimuli into different streams, and subsequently decide which streams are most pertinent to them. Thus, it has been proposed that one's sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli, identifying discrete pieces of information and classifying them by salience.[5] This effect is what allows most people to "tune into" a single voice and "tune out" all others. It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance originating from unattended stimuli, for instance hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input.

鸡尾酒会效应（英语：cocktail party effect）是指人的一种听力选择能力，在这种情况下，注意力集中在某一个人的谈话之中而忽略背景中其他的对话或噪音。该效应揭示了人类听觉系统中令人惊奇的能力，即我们可以在噪声中谈话。
鸡尾酒会现象是图形-背景现象的听觉版本。这里的“图形”是我们所注意或引起我们注意的声音，“背景”是其他的声音。
