### What on Earth is the Amygdala and How Is It Related to Social Anxiety?

The amygdalae are groups of nuclei in the temporal lobes of our brain which play a crucial role in processing decisions and emotions and consolidating memories. It is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain control different cognitive and motor functions, and likewise, amygdalae perform different tasks depending on the hemisphere where they reside. Studies have shown that the right amygdalae produce negative emotions such as fear and sadness, whereas the left amygdala not only produce those, but also positive feelings.

### Phobias (Phobic Disorders)

Phobic disorders (phobias) involve persistent, irrational fears and avoidance of the situations or objects that induce these fears. They may be the most common form of anxiety.


There are different types of phobias. One of the most familiar is agoraphobia, or the fear of being in public places; it often stems from panic disorder as a result of trying to avoid places that have triggered past attacks.

Another common form of phobic disorder is social phobia, which is characterized by an undue fear of embarrassment in social situations.

Other phobias are classified as “specific,” meaning they are related to specific circumstances—for example, a fear of a specific type of animal (such as a fear of dogs, or cyanophobia), which is the most common type of specific phobia. Another example is the fear of heights (acrophobia).

While certain situations or objects, such as flying or snakes, provoke a mild degree of anxiety in many, those with a phobic disorder have an excessive amount of fear and anxiety that is out of proportion to the actual threat. In addition, phobic disorders significantly impair the individual’s social or occupational performance.

#### What Causes Phobic Disorders?

* As is the case with other anxiety states, the causes of phobias aren’t clearly established. Probably a combination of environmental and genetic factors play a role.
* Phobias tend to run in families. If you have a family member who suffers from a phobic disorder, you may be more vulnerable to the condition.

### obsessive-compulsive disorder

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.

People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both. These symptoms can interfere with all aspects of life, such as work, school, and personal relationships.

Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include:

* Fear of germs or contamination
* Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, and harm
* Aggressive thoughts towards others or self
* Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order

Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include:

* Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing
* Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way
* Repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked or that the oven is off
* Compulsive counting

Not all rituals or habits are compulsions. Everyone double checks things sometimes. But a person with OCD generally:

* Can't control his or her thoughts or behaviors, even when those thoughts or behaviors are recognized as excessive
* Spends at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors
* Doesn’t get pleasure when performing the behaviors or rituals, but may feel brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause
* Experiences significant problems in their daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors

Some individuals with OCD also have a tic disorder. Motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements, such as eye blinking and other eye movements, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Common vocal tics include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds.

Symptoms may come and go, ease over time, or worsen. People with OCD may try to help themselves by avoiding situations that trigger their obsessions, or they may use alcohol or drugs to calm themselves. Although most adults with OCD recognize that what they are doing doesn’t make sense, some adults and most children may not realize that their behavior is out of the ordinary. Parents or teachers typically recognize OCD symptoms in children.

强迫症的病因复杂、尚无定论，目前认为主要与心理社会、个性、遗传及神经-内分泌等因素有关。

许多研究表明患者在首次发病时常遭受过一些不良生活事件，如人际关系紧张、婚姻遇到考验、学习工作受挫等等。强迫症患者个性中或多或少存在追求完美、对自己和他人高标准严要求的倾向，有一部分患者病前即有强迫型人格，表现为过分的谨小慎微、责任感过强、希望凡事都能尽善尽美，因而在处理不良生活事件时缺乏弹性，表现得难以适应。患者内心所经历的矛盾、焦虑最后只能通过强迫性的症状表达出来。

另外，近年来大量研究发现强迫症的发病可能存在一定遗传倾向，在神经-内分泌方面也存在功能紊乱，造成诸如5-羟色胺、多巴胺等神经递质失衡，无法正常发挥其生理功能。

### Dissociative disorder

Dissociative disorders (DD) are conditions that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory, awareness, identity, or perception. People with dissociative disorders use dissociation, as a defence mechanism, pathologically and involuntarily. Some dissociative disorders are triggered by psychological trauma, but dissociative disorders such as depersonalization/derealization disorder may be preceded only by stress, psychoactive substances, or no identifiable trigger at all. 

The dissociative disorders listed in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 are as follows:

* Dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder): the alternation of two or more distinct personality states with impaired recall among personality states. In extreme cases, the host personality is unaware of the other, alternating personalities; however, the alternate personalities can be aware of all the existing personalities. This category now includes the old derealization disorder category.分离性（解离性）身份识别障碍(Dissociative Identity Disorder，DID)，以往被称为多重人格障碍(Multiple-Personality Disorder，MPD)，在某些出版物种也称之为解离性人格疾患。根据DSM-IV-TR，它是指一种戏剧性的解离性障碍，在这种障碍中显示出两种或更多的不同的身份或人格状态，这些中不同身份与人格交替以某种方式控制着患者的行为。分离性身份障碍是多种因素相互作用的结果：强烈的应激,能力的分离(包括在意识中将个人的记忆,知觉和身份统一),成长过程中防御能力的习得,童年期遭受伤害后缺乏同情和抚慰以及对今后伤害性刺激的自我保护的能力缺乏等.身份认同的统一并不是与生俱来,它依赖于后天各种资源和经验而发展.在遭受创伤的孩童,这种发育被阻断,许多本该组合于同一身份中的特质仍然处于孤立状态.北美地区的研究显示,97%~98%分离性障碍成年病人报告童年虐待史,同时在85%的成年病人和95%的儿童,青少年分离性障碍以及其他形式相近的分离性障碍病人身上,可以验证有虐待史。个体的发展有赖于儿童时期将各种复杂的信息和经验成功地整合.当儿童获得对自己和周围人统一而复杂的认识后,他们将顺利渡过那些不同的知觉和情感分离的阶段.每个发育时期都产生有不同自我,同时并不是每个经受童年虐待和创伤的人都发展成多重人格.多重人格病人容易被催眠,而这一特质与分离性素质密切相联,同时它被认为是分离性障碍的患病因素之一.当然,绝大多数具有这些特质的儿童还是具有正常的适应能力,并且能够在成人的保护和抚慰下,不会发展成分离性身份障碍.
* Dissociative amnesia (formerly psychogenic amnesia): the temporary loss of recall memory, specifically episodic memory, due to a traumatic or stressful event. It is considered the most common dissociative disorder amongst those documented. This disorder can occur abruptly or gradually and may last minutes to years depending on the severity of the trauma and the patient.解离性失忆被认为是最常见的解离症，此病最常见的是对个人身份（personal identity）失忆，但对一般资讯的记忆则是完整的。解离性失忆症患者中女性多於男性，年轻成年人多於年长的。这一类个案的失忆发作通常很突然，患者会无法回忆先前的生活、或人格，且主要是失去过去的记忆，特别是创伤性的生活事件。
* Dissociative fugue (formerly psychogenic fugue) is now subsumed under the dissociative amnesia category. It is described as reversible amnesia for personal identity, usually involving unplanned travel or wandering, sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. This state is typically associated with stressful life circumstances and can be short or lengthy.
* Depersonalization disorder: periods of detachment from self or surrounding which may be experienced as "unreal" (lacking in control of or "outside" self) while retaining awareness that this is only a feeling and not a reality.
* The old category of dissociative disorder not otherwise specified is now split into two: Other specified dissociative disorder, and unspecified dissociative disorder. These categories are used for forms of pathological dissociation that do not fully meet the criteria of the other specified dissociative disorders, or if the correct category has not been determined.

### Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).

When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.

Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.

Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy).

There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.

* Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).
* Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.
* Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).
* Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.

Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment.

Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time.

双相障碍属于心境障碍的一种类型，英文名称为Bipolar Disorder（BP），英文别名Bipolar Affective Disorder，指既有躁狂发作又有抑郁发作的一类疾病。
因未明，生物、心理与社会环境诸多方面因素参与其发病过程，目前强调遗传与环境或应激因素之间的交互作用、以及这种交互作用的出现时点在双相障碍发生过程中具有重要的影响，临床表现按照发作特点可以分为抑郁发作、躁狂发作或混合发作。

### Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. Although schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders, the symptoms can be very disabling.

Symptoms of schizophrenia usually start between ages 16 and 30. In rare cases, children have schizophrenia too.

The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive.

Positive symptoms: “Positive” symptoms are psychotic behaviors not generally seen in healthy people. People with positive symptoms may “lose touch” with some aspects of reality. Symptoms include:

* Hallucinations
* Delusions
* Thought disorders (unusual or dysfunctional ways of thinking)
* Movement disorders (agitated body movements)

Negative symptoms: “Negative” symptoms are associated with disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. Symptoms include:

* “Flat affect” (reduced expression of emotions via facial expression or voice tone)
* Reduced feelings of pleasure in everyday life
* Difficulty beginning and sustaining activities
* Reduced speaking

Cognitive symptoms: For some patients, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more severe and patients may notice changes in their memory or other aspects of thinking. Symptoms include:

* Poor “executive functioning” (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)
* Trouble focusing or paying attention
* Problems with “working memory” (the ability to use information immediately after learning it)

精神分裂症是一组病因未明的重性精神病，多在青壮年缓慢或亚急性起病，临床上往往表现为症状各异的综合征，涉及感知觉、思维、情感和行为等多方面的障碍以及精神活动的不协调。患者一般意识清楚，智能基本正常，但部分患者在疾病过程中会出现认知功能的损害。病程一般迁延，呈反复发作、加重或恶化，部分患者最终出现衰退和精神残疾，但有的患者经过治疗后可保持痊愈或基本痊愈状态。

# Personality Disorder

#### What is “Personality?”

Personality refers to a distinctive set of traits, behavior styles, and patterns that make up our character or individuality. How we perceive the world, our attitudes, thoughts, and feelings are all part of our personality. People with healthy personalities are able to cope with normal stresses and have no trouble forming relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.

#### What is a Personality Disorder?

Those who struggle with a personality disorder have great difficulty dealing with other people. They tend to be inflexible, rigid, and unable to respond to the changes and demands of life. Although they feel that their behavior patterns are “normal” or “right,” people with personality disorders tend to have a narrow view of the world and find it difficult to participate in social activities.

#### Recognizing a Personality Disorder

A personality disorder must fulfill several criteria. A deeply ingrained, inflexible pattern of relating, perceiving, and thinking serious enough to cause distress or impaired functioning is a personality disorder. Personality disorders are usually recognizable by adolescence or earlier, continue throughout adulthood, and become less obvious throughout middle age.

#### What Causes a Personality Disorder?

Some experts believe that events occurring in early childhood exert a powerful influence upon behavior later in life. Others indicate that people are genetically predisposed to personality disorders. In some cases, however, environmental facts may cause a person who is already genetically vulnerable to develop a personality disorder.

#### Types of Personality Disorders

There are many formally identified personality disorders, each with their own set of behaviors and symptoms. Many of these fall into three different categories or clusters:

* Cluster A: Odd or eccentric behavior
* Cluster B: Dramatic, emotional or erratic behavior
* Cluster C: Anxious fearful behavior

Since there are too many identified types of personality disorders to explain in this context, we will only review a few in each cluster.

##### Cluster A:

* Schizoid Personality Disorder. Schizoid personalities are introverted, withdrawn, solitary, emotionally cold, and distant. They are often absorbed with their own thoughts and feelings and are fearful of closeness and intimacy with others. For example, a person suffering from schizoid personality is more of a daydreamer than a practical action taker.
* Paranoid Personality Disorder. The essential feature for this type of personality disorder is interpreting the actions of others as deliberately threatening or demeaning. People with paranoid personality disorder are untrusting, unforgiving, and prone to angry or aggressive outbursts without justification because they perceive others as unfaithful, disloyal, condescending or deceitful. This type of person may also be jealous, guarded, secretive, and scheming, and may appear to be emotionally “cold” or excessively serious.
* Schizotypal Personality Disorder. A pattern of peculiarities best describes those with schizotypal personality disorder. People may have odd or eccentric manners of speaking or dressing. Strange, outlandish or paranoid beliefs and thoughts are common. People with schizotypal personality disorder have difficulties forming relationships and experience extreme anxiety in social situations. They may react inappropriately or not react at all during a conversation or they may talk to themselves. They also display signs of “magical thinking” by saying they can see into the future or read other people’s minds.

#### Cluster B:

* Antisocial Personality Disorder. People with antisocial personality disorder characteristically act out their conflicts and ignore normal rules of social behavior. These individuals are impulsive, irresponsible, and callous. Typically, the antisocial personality has a history of legal difficulties, belligerent and irresponsible behavior, aggressive and even violent relationships. They show no respect for other people and feel no remorse about the effects of their behavior on others. These people ware at high risk for substance abuse, especially alcoholism, since it helps them to relieve tension, irritability and boredom.
* Borderline Personality Disorder. People with borderline personality disorder are unstable in several areas, including interpersonal relationships, behavior, mood, and self-image. Abrupt and extreme mood changes, stormy interpersonal relationships, an unstable and fluctuating self-image, unpredictable and self-destructive actions characterize the person with borderline personality disorder. These individuals generally have great difficulty with their own sense of identity. They often experience the world in extremes, viewing others as either “all good” or “all bad.” A person with borderline personality may form an intense personal attachment with someone only to quickly dissolve it over a perceived slight. Fears of abandonment may lead to an excessive dependency on others. Self-multilation or recurrent suicidal gestures may be used to get attention or manipulate others. Impulsive actions, chronic feelings of boredom or emptiness, and bouts of intense inappropriate anger are other traits of this disorder, which is more common among females.
* Narcissistic Personality Disorder. People with narcissistic personality have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, are absorbed by fantasies of unlimited success, and seek constant attention. The narcissistic personality is oversensitive to failure and often complains of multiple somatic symptoms. Prone to extreme mood swings between self-admiration and insecurity, these people tend to exploit interpersonal relationships.

#### Cluster C:

* Avoidant Personality Disorder. Avoidant personalities are often hypersensitive to rejection and are unwilling to become involved with others unless they are sure of being liked. Excessive social discomfort, timidity, fear of criticism, avoidance of social or work activities that involve interpersonal contact are characteristic of the avoidant personality. They are fearful of saying something considered foolish by others; worry they will blush or cry in front of others; and are very hurt by any disapproval by others. People with avoidant personality disorder may have no close relationships outside of their family circle, although they would like to, and are upset at their inability to relate well to others.
* Dependent Personality Disorder. People with dependent personality disorder may exhibit a pattern of dependent and submissive behavior, relying on others to make decisions for them. They require excessive reassurance and advice, and are easily hurt by criticism or disapproval. They feel uncomfortable and helpless if they are alone, and can be devastated when a close relationship ends. They have a strong fear of rejection. Typically lacking in self-confidence, the dependent personality rarely initiates projects or does things independently. This disorder usually begins by early adulthood and is diagnosed more frequently in females than males.
* Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. Compulsive personalities are conscientious and have high levels of aspiration, but they also strive for perfection. Never satisfied with their achievements, people with compulsive personality disorder take on more and more responsibilities. They are reliable, dependable, orderly, and methodical, but their inflexibility often makes them incapable of adapting to changed circumstances. People with compulsive personality are highly cautious, weigh all aspects of a problem, and pay attention to every detail, making it difficult for them to make decisions and complete tasks. When their feelings are not under strict control, events are unpredictable, or they must rely on others, compulsive personalities often feel a sense of isolation and helplessness.

#### How are Personality Disorders Treated?

When these characteristics are carried to an extreme, when they endure over time and when they interfere with healthy functioning, a diagnostic evaluation with a licensed physician or mental health professional is recommended.

There are many types of help available for the different personality disorders. Treatment may include individual, group, or family psychotherapy. Medications, prescribed by a patient’s physician, may also be helpful in relieving some of the symptoms of personality disorders, including problems with anxiety and perceptions.

Psychotherapy for patients with personality disorders focuses on helping them see the unconscious conflicts that are contributing to or causing their symptoms. It also helps people become more flexible and is aimed at reducing the behavior patterns that interfere with everyday living.

In psychotherapy, people with personality disorders can better recognize the effects of their behavior on others. Behavior and cognitive therapies focus on resolving symptoms or traits that are characteristic of the disorder, such as the inability to make important life decisions or the inability to initiate relationships.

# Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is a disorder that is characterized by a long-standing pattern of disregard for other people’s rights, often crossing the line and violating those rights. A person with antisocial personality disorder (APD) often feels little or no empathy toward other people, and doesn’t see the problem in bending or breaking the law for their own needs or wants. The disorder usually begins in childhood or as a teen and continues into a person’s adult life.

Antisocial personality disorder is often referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy in popular culture. However, neither psychopathy nor sociopathy are recognized professional labels used for diagnosis.

Individuals with antisocial personality disorder frequently lack empathy and tend to be callous, cynical, and contemptuous of the feelings, rights, and sufferings of others. They may have an inflated and arrogant self-appraisal (e.g., feel that ordinary work is beneath them or lack a realistic concern about their current problems or their future) and may be excessively opinionated, self-assured, or cocky. They may display a glib, superficial charm and can be quite voluble and verbally facile (e.g., using technical terms or jargon that might impress someone who is unfamiliar with the topic).

Lack of empathy, inflated self-appraisal, and superficial charm are features that have been commonly included in traditional conceptions of psychopathy and may be particularly distinguishing of antisocial personality disorder in prison or forensic settings where criminal, delinquent, or aggressive acts are likely to be nonspecific. These individuals may also be irresponsible and exploitative in their sexual relationships.

A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates from the norm of the individual’s culture. The pattern is seen in two or more of the following areas: cognition; affect; interpersonal functioning; or impulse control. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. It typically leads to significant distress or impairment in social, professional, or other areas of functioning. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back to early adulthood or adolescence.

### Symptoms of Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed when a person’s pattern of antisocial behavior has occurred since age 15 (although only adults 18 years or older can be diagnosed with this disorder) and consists of the majority of these symptoms:

* Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest
* Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure
* Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead
* Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults
* Reckless disregard for safety of self or others
* Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations

There should also be evidence of conduct disorder in the individual as a child, whether or not it was ever formally diagnosed by a professional.

Because personality disorders describe long-standing and enduring patterns of behavior, they are most often diagnosed in adulthood. It is uncommon for them to be diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, because a child or teen is under constant development, personality changes, and maturation. According to the DSM-5, antisocial personality disorder cannot be diagnosed in people younger than 18 years old.

Antisocial personality disorder is 70 percent more prevalent in males than females. According to research, the 12-month prevalence rate of this disorder is between 0.2 and 3.3 percent in the general population.

Like most personality disorders, antisocial personality disorder typically will decrease in intensity with age, with many people experiencing few of the disorder’s symptoms by the time they are in their 40s or 50s.

反社会型人格障碍（antisocial personality disorder）又称无情型人格障碍（affectionless personality disorder）或社会性病态（sociopathy），是对社会影响最为严重的类型。患病率在发达的国家为4.3-9.4%，我国台湾地区为0.3% 。反社会型人格障碍的特征是高度攻击性，缺乏羞惭感，不能从经历中取得经验教训，行为受偶然动机驱使，社会适应不良等，然而这些均属相对的。

“反社会”一语虽系政治社会用语，但也从这一侧面突出反映了他们对社会的危害，这类人在监狱和劳教机构占相当大比率（40%-78%），不少是累犯或惯犯，往往因发生反应状态而送精神病机构要求医学鉴定。
反社会人格障碍虽然经常发生违纪行为，但与一般犯罪是有区别的，尽管二者对所犯罪行为均负有完全责任能力，司法精神科医生和司法工作者应区分反社会人格犯罪和不法分子作案：①一般犯罪者往往有计划和有预谋地达成犯罪，反社会人格多不能；②犯罪者违法目的明显，反社会人格多受情感冲动支配，犯罪动机较模糊；③犯罪者在他人受害时作案手法隐蔽和狡诈，企图逃避罪责，反社会人格害人害己，而对自己的危害尤大；④具有反社会人格的人较少造成凶杀或其他严重案件以致判处极刑；⑤一般犯罪的人格固然是有缺陷的，但未达到人格障碍程度，而反社会人格则在心理活动的各个方面都有沉重的影响，反映在生活的各个侧面出现持续和长期的行为障碍。

Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another

### Insight therapy

Insight therapy is a type of therapy that helps you see the reasons for your negative behaviors, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. The idea is that once you see that you are the one controlling your behaviors, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings, that you will be able to make the changes needed. Believe it or not, Sigmund Freud is the one who began using insight therapy back in the early 1900s at the Psychoanalyst School of Psychology. The therapist may try to get to the root of your issues by talking about your past or your childhood to determine what may be the trigger to these feelings.

This is an indirect type of therapy that lets you do most of the talking rather than having the therapist ask the questions and lead you to where he or she thinks the problems may be, like with behavior therapy. Insight therapy is more like a friendly chat rather than a therapy session and many people feel most comfortable with this type of therapy. Even though it is still a form of psychotherapy, it lets you discover how your past influences your current actions and behaviors.

### Humanistic Therapy

#### What Is Humanistic Therapy?

Also known as humanism, humanistic therapy is a positive approach to psychotherapy that focuses on a person’s individual nature, rather than categorizing groups of people with similar characteristics as having the same problems. Humanistic therapy looks at the whole person, not only from the therapist’s view but from the viewpoint of individuals observing their own behavior. The emphasis is on a person’s positive traits and behaviors, and the ability to use their personal instincts to find wisdom, growth, healing, and fulfillment within themselves.

#### When It's Used

Humanistic therapy is used to treat depression, anxiety, panic disorders, personality disorders, schizophrenia, addiction, and relationship issues, including family relationships. People with low self-esteem, who are having trouble finding their purpose or reaching their true potential, who lack feelings of “wholeness,” who are searching for personal meaning, or who are not comfortable with themselves as they are, may also benefit from humanistic therapy.

#### What to Expect

Humanistic therapy is talk therapy that encompasses a gestalt approach, exploring how a person feels in the here and now, rather than trying to identify past events that led to these feelings. Additionally, the humanistic therapist provides an atmosphere of support, empathy, and trust that allows the individual to share their feelings without fear of judgment. The therapist does not act as an authority figure; rather, the relationship between client and the therapist is one of equals.

#### How It Works

In the late 1950s, humanism grew out of a need to address what some psychologists saw as the limitations and negative theories of behavioral and psychoanalytic schools of therapy. This was a new, more holistic approach that focused less on pathology, past experiences, and environmental influences on a person’s behavior, and more on the positive side of human nature. Around this time, psychotherapist Abraham Maslow developed a human hierarchy of needs and motivations, and fellow therapist Carl Rogers developed his person-centered approach. Humanistic therapy evolved from these theories. Humanistic therapists believe people are inherently motivated to fulfill their internal needs and their individual potential to become self-actualized. Self-actualization can take many forms, including creative endeavors, spiritual enlightenment, a pursuit of wisdom, or altruism.

### Client-Centered Therapy

One major difference between humanistic counselors and other therapists is that they refer to those in therapy as 'clients', not 'patients'.  This is because they see the therapist and client as equal partners rather than as an expert treating a patient. 

Unlike other therapies the client is responsible for improving his or her life, not the therapist.  This is a deliberate change from both psychoanalysis and behavioral therapies where the patient is diagnosed and treated by a doctor.  Instead, the client consciously and rationally decides for themselves what is wrong and what should be done about it.  The therapist is more of a friend or counselor who listens and encourages on an equal level.

One reason why Rogers (1951) rejected interpretation was that he believed that, although symptoms did arise from past experience, it was more useful for the client to focus on the present and future than on the past.  Rather than just liberating clients from their past, as psychodynamic therapists aim to do, Rogerians hope to help their clients to achieve personal growth and eventually to self-actualize.

There is an almost total absence of techniques in Rogerian psychotherapy due to the unique character of each counseling relationship.  Of utmost importance, however, is the quality of the relationship between client and therapist.

If there are any techniques they are listening, accepting, understanding and sharing, which seem more attitude-orientated than skills-orientated.  In Corey's (1991) view 'a preoccupation with using techniques is seen [from the Rogerian standpoint] as depersonalizing the relationship'.  The Rogerian client-centered approach puts emphasis on the person coming to form an appropriate understanding of their world and themselves.

A person enters person centered therapy in a state of incongruence.  It is the role of the therapists to reverse this situation.  Rogers (1959) called his therapeutic approach client-centered or person-centered therapy because of the focus on the person’s subjective view of the world.

Rogers regarded everyone as a “potentially competent individual” who could benefit greatly from his form of therapy.  The purpose of Roger’s humanistic therapy is to increase a person’s feelings of self-worth, reduce the level of incongruence between the ideal and actual self, and help a person become more of a fully functioning person.

#### Core Conditions

Client-centered therapy operates according to three basic principles that reflect the attitude of the therapist to the client:

1. The therapist is congruent with the client.  
2. The therapist provides the client with unconditional positive regard.  
3. The therapist shows empathetic understanding to the client.  

### Systematic desensitization

Joseph Wolpe, a pioneer of behavioral therapy, developed a technique called systematic desensitization for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders and phobias. This technique is based on the principles of classical conditioning and the premise that what has been learned (conditioned) can be unlearned. Ample research shows that systematic desensitization is effective in reducing anxiety and panic attacks associated with fearful situations.

Systematic desensitization usually starts with imagining yourself in a progression of fearful situations and using relaxation strategies that compete with anxiety. Once you can successfully manage your anxiety while imagining fearful events, you can use the technique in real life situations. The goal of the process is to become gradually desensitized to the triggers that are causing your distress.

Before beginning systematic desensitization, you need to have mastered relaxation training and developed a hierarchy (from least feared to most feared) list of your feared situations. If you have difficulty getting to a state of relaxation or identifying your anxiety hierarchy, you should consult with a professional who will be able to provide you with guidance.

Systematic desensitization begins with imaginary exposure to feared situations. Use your anxiety hierarchy to break down the feared situation into manageable components.

For example, let’s say you fear going into large stores. You may have the least anxiety walking into the store. As you get further from the exit doors, your anxiety intensifies. Standing in the checkout line represents your highest fear response. You would start the process by focusing on the action that causes the least amount of distress and work your way up. The result is that you will gradually, or systematically, become desensitized to shopping in large stores.

### Neurotransmitter

A neurotransmitter is defined as a chemical messenger that carries, boosts, and balances signals between neurons, or nerve cells, and other cells in the body. These chemical messengers can affect a wide variety of both physical and psychological functions including heart rate, sleep, appetite, mood, and fear. Billions of neurotransmitter molecules work constantly to keep our brains functioning, managing everything from our breathing to our heartbeat to our learning and concentration levels.

#### How Neurotransmitters Work

In order for neurons to send messages throughout the body, they need to be able to communicate with one another to transmit signals. However, neurons are not simply connected to one another. At the end of each neuron is a tiny gap called a synapse and in order to communicate with the next cell, the signal needs to be able to cross this small space. This occurs through a process known as neurotransmission.

In most cases, a neurotransmitter is released from what's known as the axon terminal after an action potential has reached the synapse, a place where neurons can transmit signals to each other.

When an electrical signal reaches the end of a neuron, it triggers the release of small sacs called vesicles that contain the neurotransmitters. These sacs spill their contents into the synapse, where the neurotransmitters then move across the gap toward the neighboring cells. These cells contain receptors where the neurotransmitters can bind and trigger changes in the cells.


After release, the neurotransmitter crosses the synaptic gap and attaches to the receptor site on the other neuron, either exciting or inhibiting the receiving neuron depending on what the neurotransmitter is.  The neurotransmitters act like a key and the receptor site act like a lock. It takes the right key to open specific locks. If the neurotransmitter is able to work on the receptor site, it triggers changes in the receiving cell.


Sometimes neurotransmitters can bind to receptors and cause an electrical signal to be transmitted down the cell (excitatory). In other cases, the neurotransmitter can actually block the signal from continuing, preventing the message from being carried on (inhibitory).


So what happens to a neurotransmitter after its job is complete? Once the neurotransmitter has had the designed effect, its activity can be stopped by different mechanisms.

* It can be degraded or deactivated by enzymes
* It can drift away from the receptor
* It can be taken back up by the axon of the neuron that released it in a process known as reuptake

Neurotransmitters can be classified by their function:

* Excitatory neurotransmitters: These types of neurotransmitters have excitatory effects on the neuron, meaning they increase the likelihood that the neuron will fire an action potential. Some of the major excitatory neurotransmitters include epinephrine and norepinephrine.  
* Inhibitory neurotransmitters: These types of neurotransmitters have inhibitory effects on the neuron; they decrease the likelihood that the neuron will fire an action potential. Some of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters include serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  

Some neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and dopamine, can create both excitatory and inhibitory effects depending upon the type of receptors that are present.
