### What on Earth is the Amygdala and How Is It Related to Social Anxiety?

The amygdalae are groups of nuclei in the temporal lobes of our brain which play a crucial role in processing decisions and emotions and consolidating memories. It is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain control different cognitive and motor functions, and likewise, amygdalae perform different tasks depending on the hemisphere where they reside. Studies have shown that the right amygdalae produce negative emotions such as fear and sadness, whereas the left amygdala not only produce those, but also positive feelings.

### Phobias (Phobic Disorders)

Phobic disorders (phobias) involve persistent, irrational fears and avoidance of the situations or objects that induce these fears. They may be the most common form of anxiety.


There are different types of phobias. One of the most familiar is agoraphobia, or the fear of being in public places; it often stems from panic disorder as a result of trying to avoid places that have triggered past attacks.

Another common form of phobic disorder is social phobia, which is characterized by an undue fear of embarrassment in social situations.

Other phobias are classified as “specific,” meaning they are related to specific circumstances—for example, a fear of a specific type of animal (such as a fear of dogs, or cyanophobia), which is the most common type of specific phobia. Another example is the fear of heights (acrophobia).

While certain situations or objects, such as flying or snakes, provoke a mild degree of anxiety in many, those with a phobic disorder have an excessive amount of fear and anxiety that is out of proportion to the actual threat. In addition, phobic disorders significantly impair the individual’s social or occupational performance.

#### What Causes Phobic Disorders?

* As is the case with other anxiety states, the causes of phobias aren’t clearly established. Probably a combination of environmental and genetic factors play a role.
* Phobias tend to run in families. If you have a family member who suffers from a phobic disorder, you may be more vulnerable to the condition.

### obsessive-compulsive disorder

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.

People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both. These symptoms can interfere with all aspects of life, such as work, school, and personal relationships.

Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include:

* Fear of germs or contamination
* Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, and harm
* Aggressive thoughts towards others or self
* Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order

Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include:

* Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing
* Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way
* Repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked or that the oven is off
* Compulsive counting

Not all rituals or habits are compulsions. Everyone double checks things sometimes. But a person with OCD generally:

* Can't control his or her thoughts or behaviors, even when those thoughts or behaviors are recognized as excessive
* Spends at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors
* Doesn’t get pleasure when performing the behaviors or rituals, but may feel brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause
* Experiences significant problems in their daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors

Some individuals with OCD also have a tic disorder. Motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements, such as eye blinking and other eye movements, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Common vocal tics include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds.

Symptoms may come and go, ease over time, or worsen. People with OCD may try to help themselves by avoiding situations that trigger their obsessions, or they may use alcohol or drugs to calm themselves. Although most adults with OCD recognize that what they are doing doesn’t make sense, some adults and most children may not realize that their behavior is out of the ordinary. Parents or teachers typically recognize OCD symptoms in children.

强迫症的病因复杂、尚无定论，目前认为主要与心理社会、个性、遗传及神经-内分泌等因素有关。

许多研究表明患者在首次发病时常遭受过一些不良生活事件，如人际关系紧张、婚姻遇到考验、学习工作受挫等等。强迫症患者个性中或多或少存在追求完美、对自己和他人高标准严要求的倾向，有一部分患者病前即有强迫型人格，表现为过分的谨小慎微、责任感过强、希望凡事都能尽善尽美，因而在处理不良生活事件时缺乏弹性，表现得难以适应。患者内心所经历的矛盾、焦虑最后只能通过强迫性的症状表达出来。

另外，近年来大量研究发现强迫症的发病可能存在一定遗传倾向，在神经-内分泌方面也存在功能紊乱，造成诸如5-羟色胺、多巴胺等神经递质失衡，无法正常发挥其生理功能。

### Dissociative disorder

Dissociative disorders (DD) are conditions that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory, awareness, identity, or perception. People with dissociative disorders use dissociation, as a defence mechanism, pathologically and involuntarily. Some dissociative disorders are triggered by psychological trauma, but dissociative disorders such as depersonalization/derealization disorder may be preceded only by stress, psychoactive substances, or no identifiable trigger at all. 

The dissociative disorders listed in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 are as follows:

* Dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder): the alternation of two or more distinct personality states with impaired recall among personality states. In extreme cases, the host personality is unaware of the other, alternating personalities; however, the alternate personalities can be aware of all the existing personalities. This category now includes the old derealization disorder category.分离性（解离性）身份识别障碍(Dissociative Identity Disorder，DID)，以往被称为多重人格障碍(Multiple-Personality Disorder，MPD)，在某些出版物种也称之为解离性人格疾患。根据DSM-IV-TR，它是指一种戏剧性的解离性障碍，在这种障碍中显示出两种或更多的不同的身份或人格状态，这些中不同身份与人格交替以某种方式控制着患者的行为。分离性身份障碍是多种因素相互作用的结果：强烈的应激,能力的分离(包括在意识中将个人的记忆,知觉和身份统一),成长过程中防御能力的习得,童年期遭受伤害后缺乏同情和抚慰以及对今后伤害性刺激的自我保护的能力缺乏等.身份认同的统一并不是与生俱来,它依赖于后天各种资源和经验而发展.在遭受创伤的孩童,这种发育被阻断,许多本该组合于同一身份中的特质仍然处于孤立状态.北美地区的研究显示,97%~98%分离性障碍成年病人报告童年虐待史,同时在85%的成年病人和95%的儿童,青少年分离性障碍以及其他形式相近的分离性障碍病人身上,可以验证有虐待史。个体的发展有赖于儿童时期将各种复杂的信息和经验成功地整合.当儿童获得对自己和周围人统一而复杂的认识后,他们将顺利渡过那些不同的知觉和情感分离的阶段.每个发育时期都产生有不同自我,同时并不是每个经受童年虐待和创伤的人都发展成多重人格.多重人格病人容易被催眠,而这一特质与分离性素质密切相联,同时它被认为是分离性障碍的患病因素之一.当然,绝大多数具有这些特质的儿童还是具有正常的适应能力,并且能够在成人的保护和抚慰下,不会发展成分离性身份障碍.
* Dissociative amnesia (formerly psychogenic amnesia): the temporary loss of recall memory, specifically episodic memory, due to a traumatic or stressful event. It is considered the most common dissociative disorder amongst those documented. This disorder can occur abruptly or gradually and may last minutes to years depending on the severity of the trauma and the patient.解离性失忆被认为是最常见的解离症，此病最常见的是对个人身份（personal identity）失忆，但对一般资讯的记忆则是完整的。解离性失忆症患者中女性多於男性，年轻成年人多於年长的。这一类个案的失忆发作通常很突然，患者会无法回忆先前的生活、或人格，且主要是失去过去的记忆，特别是创伤性的生活事件。
* Dissociative fugue (formerly psychogenic fugue) is now subsumed under the dissociative amnesia category. It is described as reversible amnesia for personal identity, usually involving unplanned travel or wandering, sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. This state is typically associated with stressful life circumstances and can be short or lengthy.
* Depersonalization disorder: periods of detachment from self or surrounding which may be experienced as "unreal" (lacking in control of or "outside" self) while retaining awareness that this is only a feeling and not a reality.
* The old category of dissociative disorder not otherwise specified is now split into two: Other specified dissociative disorder, and unspecified dissociative disorder. These categories are used for forms of pathological dissociation that do not fully meet the criteria of the other specified dissociative disorders, or if the correct category has not been determined.

### Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).

When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.

Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.

Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy).

There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.

* Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).
* Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.
* Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).
* Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.

Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment.

Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time.

双相障碍属于心境障碍的一种类型，英文名称为Bipolar Disorder（BP），英文别名Bipolar Affective Disorder，指既有躁狂发作又有抑郁发作的一类疾病。
因未明，生物、心理与社会环境诸多方面因素参与其发病过程，目前强调遗传与环境或应激因素之间的交互作用、以及这种交互作用的出现时点在双相障碍发生过程中具有重要的影响，临床表现按照发作特点可以分为抑郁发作、躁狂发作或混合发作。
