### EPISODIC & SEMANTIC MEMORY

http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html

Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into episodic memory and semantic memory.

Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. It is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated. Individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory, not just the bare facts of the event itself.

Semantic memory, on the other hand, is a more structured record of facts, meanings, concepts and knowledge about the external world that we have acquired. It refers to general factual knowledge, shared with others and independent of personal experience and of the spatial/temporal context in which it was acquired. Semantic memories may once have had a personal context, but now stand alone as simple knowledge. It therefore includes such things as types of food, capital cities, social customs, functions of objects, vocabulary, understanding of mathematics, etc. Much of semantic memory is abstract and relational and is associated with the meaning of verbal symbols.

The semantic memory is generally derived from the episodic memory, in that we learn new facts or concepts from our experiences,  and the episodic memory is considered to support and underpin semantic memory. A gradual transition from episodic to semantic memory can take place, in which episodic memory reduces its sensitivity and association to particular events, so that the information can be generalized as semantic memory.

### Procedural Memory

Procedural memory is a part of the long-term memory that is responsible for knowing how to do things, also known as motor skills. As the name implies, procedural memory stores information on how to perform certain procedures, such as walking, talking and riding a bike. Delving into something in your procedural memory does not involve conscious thought.

Procedural memory is a subset of implicit memory, sometimes referred to as unconscious memory or automatic memory. Implicit memory uses past experiences to remember things without thinking about them. It differs from declarative memory, or explicit memory, which consists of facts and events that can be explicitly stored and consciously recalled or "declared."

Some examples of tasks dependent upon procedural memory:

* Playing piano  
* Skiing  
* Ice skating  
* Playing baseball  
* Swimming  
* Driving a car  
* Riding a bike  
* Climbing stair  

### Working memory

Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that is responsible for temporarily holding information available for processing.[1] Working memory is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. Working memory is a theoretical concept central to cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience.

### Mere-exposure effect

The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds. In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often a person is seen by someone, the more pleasing and likeable that person appears to be.

### Amnesias

Amnesia is the general term for a condition in which memory (either stored memories or the process of committing something to memory) is disturbed or lost, to a greater extent than simple everyday forgetting or absent-mindedness. Amnesia may result either from organic or neurological causes (damage to the brain through physical injury, neurological disease or the use of certain drugs), or from functional or psychogenic causes (psychological factors, such as mental disorder, post-traumatic stress or psychological defence mechanisms).

There are two main types of amnesia: anterograde amnesia (where the ability to memorize new things is impaired or lost because data does not transfer successfully from the conscious short-term memory into permanent long-term memory); and retrograde amnesia (where a person's pre-existing memories are lost to conscious recollection, beyond an ordinary degree of forgetfulness, even though they may be able to memorize new things that occur after the onset of amnesia). Anterograde amnesia is the more common of the two. Sometimes both these types of amnesia may occur together, sometimes called total or global amnesia. Another type of amnesia is post-traumatic amnesia, a state of confusion and memory loss that occurs after a traumatic brain injury. Amnesia which occurs due to psychological factors is usually referred to as psychogenic amnesia.

Many kinds of amnesia are associated with damage to the hippocampus and related areas of the brain which are used in the encoding, storage and retrieval of memories. If there is a blockage in the pathways along which information travels during the processes of memory encoding or retrieval, or if whole regions of the brain are missing or damaged, then the brain may not be able to form new memories or retrieve some old ones.

The usual causes of amnesia are lesions to the brain from an accident or neurological disease, but intense stress, alcohol abuse, loss of oxygen or blood flow to the brain, etc, can all also cause amnesia, as sometimes can treatments such as electro-convulsive therapy. For example, intense stress can cause the sympathetic nervous system to activate the adrenal glands, which then secrete certain hormones into the bloodstream which can significantly affect the plasticity of the brain’s neurons (i.e. their ability to change and strengthen connections), especially those in the hippocampus.

In most cases, amnesia is a temporary condition, lasting from a few seconds to a few hours, but the duration can be longer depending on the severity of the disease or trauma, up to a few weeks or even months. In general, memories of habits (procedural memory) are usually better preserved than memories of facts and events (declarative memory), and the most distant long-term memories, such as those of childhood, are more likely to be preserved. When memories return, older memories are usually recalled first, and then more recent memories, until almost all memory is recovered.

### The Difference Between Retrograde and Anterograde Amnesia

The major difference between retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia is the following: Retrograde amnesia is the inability to recall past memories while anterograde amnesia is the inability to create new memories.

#### Anterograde Amnesia

When a person is unable to store and retain new information but is able to recall data and events that happened previously, it’s known as anterograde amnesia. Movie enthusiasts will recognize this form of amnesia from the popular film Fifty First Dates. Though the movie was fiction, it is a reflection of events that can happen in real life, and which have. 

#### Retrograde Amnesia

Retrograde amnesia occurs when a person is unable to access memories of events that happened in the past, prior to the precipitating injury or disease that caused the loss. Those who are impacted are generally able to remember meanings and other actual information, but are not able to recall specific events or situations. The severity of the condition is often indicated by what memories are retained, as under a medical principle known as Ribot’s Law, more recent memories are lost first, with more ingrained memories tending to be less likely to be dislodged. Recent studies have indicated that the extensiveness of the memory loss is a reflection of whether damage to the brain is limited to the hippocampus or also includes the temporal cortex. 

### Types of Memory 

#### Semantic memory

Semantic memory consists of those ideas, events, and information that are not related to the personal knowledge or incident of a person. It comprises the general information that the person learns and accumulates in his memory. It also enlists things that the person knows owing to his common sense. This term was first introduced by Endel Tulving. The structure and function of semantic memories is such that it organizes the information observed from the external world, and structures the information. It is traced from the episodic memory. In essence, episodic memory supports semantic memory.

The semantic memory affects the frontal lobe of the brain, which is located in the front area of the head, just at the back of the face. It is also known as the frontal cortex. It also affects the temporal lobe of the brain, which is placed on the side and rear of the frontal cortex. This means that the encoding process takes place in these areas in the semantic memory.

Example: One's knowledge about definitions, mathematical tables, formulas, poems, etc.

#### Procedural memory

Procedural memory, a term coined by Cohen and Squire, is that part of the long-term memory that helps us to perform tasks that we have already learned before, and can perform them at any given time without thinking about them consciously. It helps us to perform tasks easily without having to try hard at remembering the exact steps of how exactly it is to be done. The steps are almost etched in our minds, and the actions can be performed spontaneously. One fascinating point to note here is that this memory doesn't get erased if there is an injury caused to the brain, unlike explicit memory.

Procedural memory doesn't encode in the hippocampus. The encoding process takes place in other parts of the brain like the putamen, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and the motor cortex. Skills that are acquired or learned are stored in the putamen. Instincts are stored in the caudate nucleus, and the cerebellum takes care of the timing and coordination.

Procedural memory is the type of implicit memory that enables us to carry out commonly learned tasks without consciously thinking about them. It's our "how to" knowledge. Riding a bike, tying a shoe and washing dishes are all tasks that require procedural memory. Even what we think of as "natural" tasks, such as walking, require procedural memory. Though we can do such tasks fairly easily, it's often hard to verbalize exactly how we do them. Procedural memory likely uses a different part of the brain than episodic memory—with brain injuries, you can lose one ability without losing the other. That's why a person who has experienced amnesia and forgets much about his or her personal life often retains procedural memory: how to use a fork or drive a car, for example.

Example: One's knowledge about performing marshal arts, dancing, playing an instrument, etc.

#### Episodic memory

Episodic memory, a term coined by Endel Tulving, represents the memory of events, happenings, and experiences in a serial order. This means that the mind is able to list the events in the order of their occurrences. It stores information about the personal accounts of people. It serves as an autobiographical record of the events that took place in one's life. The episodes of memories it chooses to register depends on the importance of the event that is taking place. Episodic memory is able to recall and reconstruct the events in the exact manner in which they took place originally.

The episodic memory carries on the encoding process in the hippocampus. It is primarily vital in shaping memories. This helps in connecting the events to the senses such as sound or smell, thereby, constructing a memory or an episode. The shape of the hippocampus is like a horseshoe, and it is spread on both the right and the left hemispheres of the brain.

Example: 

* One's knowledge about the family vacation he attended ten years ago.  
* One's knowledge about his best friend in his kindergarten days.  



#### Priming

Implicit memory can also come about from priming. You are "primed" by your experiences; if you have heard something very recently, or many more times than another thing, you are primed to recall it more quickly. For instance, if you were asked to name an American city that starts with the letters "Ch," you would most likely answer Chicago, unless you have a close personal connection to or recent experience with another "Ch" city (Charlotte, Cheyenne, Charleston…) because you've heard about Chicago more often. In the brain, the neural pathways representing things we have experienced more often are more salient than those for things with which we have fewer experiences. As with short-term memory, long-term memory can weaken with age or with cognitive conditions. For example, it can be harder to complete a procedure that was previously quite easy for you. You might forget a step to baking a cake you've baked a hundred times, and that you thought you had firmly committed to memory.

Priming is that kind of implicit memory that deals with stimulus and response in an individual. The human mind contains some information that is registered permanently in his mind. So, when he gets a stimulus which has same response as that of some other stimulus, the human mind tends to give a response for that other stimulus. There are various types of priming. They are positive and negative priming, perceptual and conceptual. So, on the whole, when a person is able to produce a different response after experiencing a different stimuli, it is known as priming.

The associations that are formed between the stimuli and the responses take place automatically. It doesn't require conscious practice or memorization. The brain receives half the data from the stimulus and generates a response that it probably generates for a different stimulus. So, the brain draws the similarities between the stimuli and gives a response.

Example: One's tendency to associate red with rose more than with apple is because of priming.
