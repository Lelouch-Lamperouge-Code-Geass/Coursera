### How the Human Brain Gets Its Wrinkles?

The reason our brains have that wrinkly, walnut shape may be that the rapid growth of the brain's outer brain — the gray matter — is constrained by the white matter, a new study shows.

Researchers found that the particular pattern of the ridges and crevices of the brain's convoluted surface, which are called gyri and sulci, depends on two simple geometric parameters: the gray matter's growth rate and its thickness. The development of the brain's wrinkles can be mimicked in a lab using a double-layer gel, according to the study published today (Aug. 18) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers noted that along with these physical constraints, genes also have a role in determining the brain's shape, because they regulate how neurons proliferate and migrate to their destinations.

### gyrus(gyri)

<img src="http://www.fullfrontalanatomy.com/images/F13/NS/Brain_SC/gyri_sulci2.jpg">

A gyrus (plural: gyri) is a ridge on the surface of the brain. Each ridge is surrounded by fissures known as sulci (singular: sulcus). Gyri are unique structures that have an important evolutionary function; they increase the surface area of the brain up to an impressive 2000 centimeters squared.

This large surface area gives us better cognition without having to increase the size of the brain, which is of course trapped within the skull and hence limited by size.

There are many specific gyri which are important to the brain’s functions. For example, the superior temporal gyrus contains the Wernicke’s area, which is vital in the computation of language, while the precentral gyrus acts as the primary motor center of the brain.

As gyri are important brain structures, they have a great deal of clinical significance, with various abnormalities leading to disorders such as epilepsy.

脑回：大脑的表面凹凸不平，凸起的被称为脑回
(凹下的依其深度称为沟或裂).

### fissure

In anatomy, a fissure (Latin fissura, plural fissurae) is a groove, natural division, deep furrow, elongated cleft, or tear in various parts of the body also generally called a sulcus, or in the brain a sulcus.

大脑的神秘吸引着一代代的科学家去研究探索。在中国，尽管主流的观点是精神来源于心，但是还是有少数人持正确的认识。如秦代《黄帝内经∙素问》里说，“头者，精神之府”。明代李时珍也指出：“脑为元神之府”。两种学说都有支持者，争论持续了一千多年，但谁都拿不出有力的证据。这种混乱的情况最终由古罗马的希腊医师Galen用最为有力的证据证实。他分别对动物的心脏和脑进行夹捏刺激，发现夹捏心脏表现为呼吸急促，四肢挣扎等，而夹捏脑却出现了感觉丧失，很快昏迷，进入无意识状态，失去了全身各种有意识的活动。因此，结论很明显了，感觉思维和随意活动都是由脑产生的。同时Galen从羊脑解剖中看到了脑室，支持了当时流行的理论：机体功能依赖于4种重要的液体或体液平衡；感知被大脑所记录，运动被大脑所启动，都是由体液通过神经到达脑室和离开脑室的流动而实现；当时人们认为神经是一种类似于血管的中空管道。到18世纪，部分科学家挣脱了Galen的脑室中心论这一传统观念。解剖学家、医生等已经能够完整分离出神经系统，从而其细致的结构也被详尽地描绘叙述出来，科学家的注意力离开了脑室，而转到脑本身的白质和灰质；同时在此时期有着对脑功能重大的突破——脑回（gyri，大脑表面的隆起）及脑沟或脑裂（sulci和fissure，大脑表面的凹槽）被发现，脑回及脑沟在大脑表面组装成了叶（lobe），成为不同的脑回行使不同的大脑功能这一假设的理论基础，开创了脑功能定位研究的新时代，即特定的功能，定位在不同的脑区。直到今天神经科学已发展出许多分支，按照复杂性的递增排序有，分子神经科学，细胞神经科学，系统神经科学，行为神经科学以及认知神经科学。

### Brain

<img src="http://thefactfile-lxh7vfdm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Brain-facts-Infographics-1.png">

Brain weighs about three pounds which is about 2% of our total body weight.  Now, in fact, if you compare this to other animals, that's actually a very  high, what we call brain to body ratio. We have the biggest brain of any animal  relative to the size of our body. other animals like whales and such  obviously have bigger brains, but they have bigger bodies as well.  So, at 2%, we have the largest brain to body ratio.  but the really interesting thing is the brain is only 2% of the body, but look at  the resources it consumes. 25% of our oxygen so one of every four  breaths you take goes to your brain, as a way of thinking about it.  70% of the body's glucose supply, blood sugars goes to the brain.  So, the brain is a very sugar hungry organ in the body.  and 25% of the nutrients you eat go towards keeping your brain healthy.  So, despite its relatively small size in the body, it clearly is, a  really powerful, powerful organ that's critical to our survival.  there are about a 100 billion neurons, but perhaps more important than the, the  number of neurons are the number of connections between these neurons, 1  quadrillion. So, million, billion, trillion,  quadrillion. so there's a lot of connections, and  that's really where the brain gets its computational power.  The neurons themselves are relatively simplistic, as you'll see, and actually  transmit information in a relatively slow way.  A common copper wire transmits information much more quickly than brain  tissue does. but what the brain has is this tightly  interconnected web of connections. 

### White Matter

White matter is usually found in the deeper tissues of the brain and contains those nerve fibers that have extensions of the nerve cell. These nerve cells have a covering around them to protect the axons, and the reason behind white colour is due to the myelin sheath that not only acts as a coating but also gives the uniqueness to such matter. It increases the speed of transmission and helps the brains move stronger whenever a minor or major injury takes place. It also comes with some basic damage precautions; mostly it happens in people at a young age and gets known as the white matter disorders. Diagnosing of this issue can be helped by MRI scans which tell about the problem and different tissue levels. The most basic caution of something not going well is that the myelin sheath is not grown properly so it does help to protect the parts of brain.  At earlier stages, people thought that it does not have any especial concern in the brain and that is why no research was done to know the exact issue. Among the two matters present in the spinal cord this one is the fastest and help in connecting others parts, so they stay in touch.

白质是中枢神经系统中主要的三个组成元素之一，与灰质、黑质并列。大脑剖面中的白质组织是由大量的髓磷脂（脂质）组成，在裸视观察下呈现白色。
白质由被髓鞘包覆着的神经轴突组成，控制着神经元共享的讯号，协调脑区之间的正常运作。人类到了约二十岁时，白质才会在不同脑区逐渐发育完全，而其生长的时机与成熟程度，会影响到学习、自我控制与精神疾病，例如精神分裂、自闭症与病态性说谎，青少年的“年少轻狂”的原因之一也是由于白质未发育完全。
神经元间轴突传输讯息的速度，有髓鞘绝缘的要比没有髓鞘的快。寡突细胞制造的脂质，会缠绕轴突10~150层。有许多因子可以刺激髓鞘的形成，例如星状细胞常会“监听”轴突传送的讯号，并将化学讯息送达寡突细胞。

白质还可以让人有很好的空间方位感，男人与女人大脑的差异大部分是白质
2005年，名钢琴家乌兰与同事利用DTI来研究职业钢琴家的脑部，发现职业钢琴家的某些白质区远比非音乐家来得发达，而这些白质区所连结的大脑皮质部位，是那些协调手指运动的重要脑区，以及与创造音乐有关的其他认知脑区。乌兰还发现，每日练琴时间越长的钢琴家，这些白质束的DTI讯号就越强，轴突髓鞘越厚越紧密 [1]  。
辛辛那提儿童医院的神经科学家许密得霍斯特（Vincent J. Schmithorst）进行的另一项DTI研究似乎也与上述研究相呼应。他比较5~18岁孩童的白质之后，发现高度发展的白质构造与高IQ有直接关系。
乌兰的研究还有另一项发现：越早学习乐器的人，整个脑子的白质构造越是高度发展。青春期之后才学习乐器的人，只会增加前脑白质的发育程度，因为只剩前脑还在形成髓鞘。这个发现意味着，在某种程度上，神经纤维的髓鞘绝缘，限定了学习新技巧的年龄，这是进行或起玛是轻易进行某种学习的机会之窗或关键期

### Grey Matter

Grey Matter is defined as the major component of the human brain that has different nucleon bodies, neuropil, and some other parts that help in working on different body parts. Grey matter is more important of two matters present in brain and comes with different functions. It has become the focus of advanced research and that is why few new things are coming up. The type of fat that is present within the myelin sheath but for the grey matter, the actual colour produced from the cell structures of neurons and the brain cells that are called as glial cells. These types of cells provide energy and nutrition to the neurons, that’s how grey colour became part of the system. Most of the times it gets known as the neurons and other different cells present in the central nervous system and is part of brain, brainstem, cerebellum and inside the spinal cord.

灰质是一种神经组织，是中枢神经系统的重要组成部分，由大量的神经元胞体及其树突聚集在一起形成。灰质内形态和功能相似的神经元胞体及其树突集合在一起称为神经核。
中枢神经系统的另一个重要组成部分为白质。

灰质是中枢神经系统中大量神经元聚集的部位。在典型的灰质，例如大脑皮质中，神经元之间存在大量化学突触或电突触作为通信途径，形成极其复杂的神经回路，实现多种多样的感觉，运动或中间信息处理。所以，灰质是中枢神经系统对信息进行深入处理的部位。灰质包含大部分大脑神经元的细胞体。所涉及的大脑灰质包括区域的肌肉控制,和视听等感官知觉,记忆,情绪,言论、决策、和自我控制 。相比之下，白质由神经元的轴突组成，所以本身不具有处理信息的功能，仅仅在不同灰质之间或者灰质与外周器官之间传递信息。

### White matter vs Grey matter

脊髓的内部结构由灰质和白质组成，灰质位于中央，从横断面看呈左右对称的蝴蝶形，由各种神经细胞组成，脊髓灰质分为脊髓前角、侧角和后角，前角内有大量的运动神经细胞，侧角内含有交感神经细胞，而后角内含有感觉神经细胞；白质位于灰质的四周，由纵行的传导神经纤维组成，其主要的成分是由从大脑传达到脊髓的运动神经传导纤维组成的皮质脊髓束，以及从脊髓传达到大脑的感觉神经纤维组成的脊髓丘脑束组成

<img src="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/18117.jpg">

* White matter comprises mainly  of myelinated axons, also called tracts while grey matter few myelinated axons.  
* White matter gets it light color because of  the lipid content of myelin while grey matter actually gets it grey pinkish color  from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.  
* Grey matter contains most of the neuron somas while white matter is made up mostly of myelinated axons.  
* Grey matter is made up of nerve cell bodies, and white matter is made up of fibers.  
* Neurons of white matter has extended axons while grey matter neurons don’t.  
* Grey matter occupy 40% of the brain while white matter occupies 60%  
* Gray matter reaches it highest point of development in a person furing their twenties, the white matter  develop throughout your twenties and peaks in middle age.  

### Dendrite

These structures branch out in treelike fashion and serve as the main apparatus for receiving signals from other nerve cells. They function as an "antennae" of the neuron and are covered by thousands of synapses. The dendritic membrane under the synapse (the post-synaptic membrane) has many specialized protein molecules called receptors that detect the neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. A nerve cell can have many dendrites which branch many times, their surface is irregular and covered in dendritic spines which are where the synaptic input connections are made. 

树突，是细胞突起的一种。细胞突起是由细胞体延伸出来的细长部分，又可分为树突和轴突。细胞体的伸延部分产生的分枝称为树突,树突是接受从其它神经元传入的信息的入口。

细胞体的伸延部分产生的分枝称为树突,树突是接受从其它神经元传入的信息的入口。树突接受上一个神经的轴突释放的化学物质（递质）使该神经产生电位差形成电流传递信息.每个神经元可以有一或多个树突,可以接受刺激并将兴奋传入细胞体。由于神经递质只存在于突触前膜的突触小泡中，只能由突触的前膜释放，然后作用于突触后膜上，因此神经元之间兴奋的传递是单方向的。同时树突不一定是神经传入的唯一通道。还可以是胞体膜。

### Neuron

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Neuron.svg/1280px-Neuron.svg.png">

Neurons (also called neurones or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. More than that, their interactions define who we are as people. Having said that, our roughly 100 billion neurons do interact closely with other cell types, broadly classified as glia (these may actually outnumber neurons, although it’s not really known).

<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eJpbb.gif">

Neurons send signals to other neurons via specialized contacts known as synapses. The most common type of synapse in the nervous system is known as a chemical synapse. Typically a chemical synapse occurs between the axon terminal of the neuron sending the message, and the dendrite of the neuron receiving the message. The neuron sending the message is known as the presynaptic cell and the one receiving the message is the postsynaptic cell. In a chemical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell don’t actually touch each other, but are separated by a very tiny gap known as a synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is only 20 nanometers wide. This is teeny. In comparison, a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers thick. What a chemical synapse does, is it transforms an electrical signal (which is the action potential in the presynaptic cell’s axon) into a chemical signal (which is the neurotrasmitter) and back to an electrical signal (the postsynaptic potential) in the postsynaptic cell.

### axon

An axon, or nerve fiber, is a long slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body or soma.

Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they help make up nerves.

Individual axons are microscopic in diameter - typically about one micrometre across - but may extend to macroscopic lengths.

The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spine to the big toe of each foot.

These single-cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer.

In vertebrates, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in myelin, which is formed by either of two types of glial cells: Schwann cells ensheathing peripheral neurons and oligodendrocytes insulating those of the central nervous system.

轴突，亦称“轴索”，是指神经元借以传导神经冲动以离开细胞体的细而长的突起

### central nervous system

<img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/pmh/PMH_Authoring/media/Images/medium_thumbs/N00879_L.jpg">  

The nervous system is made up of all the nerve cells in your body. It is through the nervous system that we communicate with the outside world and, at the same time, many mechanisms inside our body are controlled. The nervous system takes in information through our senses, processes the information and triggers reactions, such as making your muscles move or causing you to feel pain. For example, if you touch a hot plate, you reflexively pull back your hand and your nerves simultaneously send pain signals to your brain. Metabolic processes are also controlled by the nervous system.

There are many billions of nerve cells, also called neurons, in the nervous system. The brain alone has about 100 billion neurons in it. Each neuron has a cell body and various extensions. The shorter extensions (called dendrites) act like antennae: they receive signals from, for example, other neurons and pass them on to the cell body. The signals are then passed on via a long extension (the axon), which can be up to a meter long.

The nervous system has two parts, called the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system due to their location in the body. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It is safely contained within the skull and vertebral canal of the spine. All of the other nerves in the body are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

中枢神经系统（Central Nervous System）由脑和脊髓的组成，（脑和脊髓是各种反射弧的中枢部分）是人体神经系统的最主体部分。中枢神经系统接受全身各处的传入信息，经它整合加工后成为协调的运动性传出，或者储存在中枢神经系统内成为学习、记忆的神经基础。人类的思维活动也是中枢神经系统的功能。

中枢神经系统（central nervous system=CNS）是神经系统的主要部分，包括位于椎管内的脊髓和位于颅腔内的脑；其位置常在动物体的中轴，由明显的脑神经节、神经索或脑和脊髓以及它们之间的连接成分组成。在中枢神经系统内大量神经细胞聚集在一起，有机地构成网络或回路；其主要功能是传递、储存和加工信息，产生各种心理活动，支配与控制动物的全部行为。

脊椎动物的中枢神经系统：脊椎动物的脑位于颅腔内，脊髓位于椎管内。脊椎动物的中枢神经系统从胚胎时身体背侧的神经管发育而成。神经管的头端演变成脑，尾端成为脊髓。神经管腔在脑内的部分发展演变成为脑室，在脊髓部分演变成为中央管。脑在开始时是3个脑：前脑泡、中脑和菱脑泡，以后又衍化成为端脑、间脑、中脑、小脑、脑桥和延髓。

脊椎动物的中枢神经系统内许多神经纤维是有髓鞘的，它们聚集在一起时，肉眼观呈白色，称白质。相反，神经细胞体集中的部位，肉眼观呈灰色，由大量神经细胞体和树突上大量突触组成，称灰质。中枢神经系统内由功能相同的神经细胞体集聚组成的，具有明确范围的灰质团块叫做神经核。在脊髓中进行的神经活动，主要是按节段进行的反射性活动；但脊椎动物的许多活动都带有整体性，这有赖于脑与脊髓之间联系来完成。在中枢神经系统内出现了许多纵向走行的神经纤维束。在脑和脊髓的左、右两侧之间也有许多连合纤维，其中最粗大的是大脑两半球之间的胼胝体。



### peripheral nervous system

<img src="https://www.nf2is.org/nf_img/cnspns.png">

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the division of the nervous system containing all the nerves that lie outside of the central nervous system (CNS). The primary role of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the organs, limbs, and skin. These nerves extend from the central nervous system to the outermost areas of the body. The peripheral system allows the brain and spinal cord to receive and send information to other areas of the body, which allows us to react to stimuli in our environment.

The nerves that make up the peripheral nervous system are actually the axons or bundles of axons from neuron cells. In some cases, these nerves are very small but some nerve bundles are so large that they can be easily seen by the human eye.

The peripheral nervous system itself is divided into two parts:

* The somatic nervous system
* The autonomic nervous system

Each of these components plays a critical role in how the peripheral nervous system operates.  

外周神经系统（peripheral nervous system），也称周围神经系统，神经系统的一部分。包括脑神经、脊神经和自主神经。脑神经共 12 对，由脑干发出，将运动信息传至头、面、颈部，或将这些部位的感觉信息经脑干传至大脑皮层。脊神经 31 对，是感觉和运动的混合神经纤维。其中感觉神经纤维进入脊髓背根，感觉信息由这里传向脊髓与脑；运动神经纤维从脊髓腹根离开，支配躯体肌肉活动。自主神经是离开中枢神经系统的运动神经元，通过脊神经或脑神经支配脏腑器官和腺体活动，包括交感神经和副交感神经。

外周神经系统，是神经系统的外周部分，它一端与中枢神经系统的脑或脊髓相连，另一端通过各种末梢装置与机体其他器官、系统相联系。它同脑相连的部分叫脑神经，共12对；它与脊髓相连的部分叫脊神经，共31对。外周神经系统又可根据其功能的不同，分为传入神经和传出神经两种：传入神经（也叫感觉神经）为将外周感受器上发生的神经冲动传到中枢的神经纤维；传出神经（也叫运动神经）为将中枢发出的神经冲动传至外周效应器的神经纤维。传出神经又可根据其支配对象而进一步分为支配骨骼肌的躯体运动神经和支配内脏器官的植物性神经。植物性神经系统又分为交感神经和副交感神经两部分.

### The Somatic Nervous System

The somatic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for carrying sensory and motor information to and from the central nervous system.


The __somatic nervous system__ derives its name from the Greek word soma, which means "body."

The __somatic system__ is responsible for transmitting sensory information as well as for voluntary movement. This system contains two major types of neurons:

* Sensory neurons (or afferent neurons) that carry information from the nerves to the central nervous system. It is these sensory neurons that allow us to take in sensory information and send it to the brain and spinal cord.   
* Motor neurons (or efferent neurons) that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to muscle fibers throughout the body. These motor neurons allow us to take physical action in response to stimuli in the environment.  

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The autonomic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for regulating involuntary body functions, such as blood flow, heartbeat, digestion, and breathing. In other words, it is the autonomic system that controls aspects of the body that are usually not under voluntary control. This system allows these functions to take place without needing to consciously think about them happening.

This system is further divided into two branches:

* The sympathetic system regulates the flight-or-fight responses. This system prepares the body to expend energy and deal with potential threats in the environment. When action is needed, the sympathetic system will trigger a response by speeding up the heart rate, increasing breathing rate, increasing blood flow to muscles, activating sweat secretion, and dilating the pupils. This allows the body to respond quickly in situations that require immediate action. In some cases, we might stay and fight the threat, while in other cases we may instead flee from the danger.  
* The parasympathetic system helps maintain normal body functions and conserve physical resources. Once a threat has passed, this system will slow the heart rate, slow breathing, reduce blood flow to muscles, and constrict the pupils. This allows us to return our bodies to a normal resting state.  

### Sympathetic Nervous System

<img src="http://activateanddominate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/para_sympathetic.jpg">

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems usually do opposite things in the body. The sympathetic nervous system prepares your body for physical and mental activity. It makes your heart beat faster and stronger, opens your airways so you can breathe more easily, and inhibits digestion.

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for bodily functions when we are at rest: it stimulates digestion, activates various metabolic processes and helps us to relax. But the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems do not always work in opposite directions; they sometimes complement each other too. 

交感神经 sympathetic nerve： 的低级中枢位于脊髓胸1～腰2或腰3节段的灰质侧柱的中间带外侧核。交感神经节前纤维起自此核的细胞，因此交感神经又称交感部或胸腰部。
交感神经的周围部包括交感干、交感神经节，以及由节发出的分支和交感神经丛等，根据交感神经节所在位置不同，又可分为椎旁节和椎前节。
活动比较广泛，刺激交感神经能引起腹腔内脏及皮肤末梢血管收缩、心搏加强和加速、新陈代谢亢进、瞳孔散大、疲乏的肌肉工作能力增加等。交感神经的活动主要保证人体紧张状态时的生理需要。
(1)对循环系统的作用：皮肤和横纹肌以及腹腔脏器的血管只接受交感神经的支配，冠状循环以及脑循环的血管都同时接受交感和副交感两种神经纤维，因此，刺 激交感神经一般可使周围动脉收缩，而在去除交感神经后可使周围动脉扩张。治疗周围血管疾患，施行交感神经切除术，即以此为依据。
(2) 对消化系统的作用：交感神经对胃肠道的作用主要是抑制，使蠕动减慢，但当胃肠紧张性太低或不活动时，交感神经冲动则可以提高并兴奋之。对消化腺的分泌功 能，交感神经的作用甚不一致，对胰和唾液腺虽可促进其分泌，但因此部的血管收缩而分泌不明显，对胃液则阻止其分泌。
(3)对呼吸系统的作用：交感神经兴奋时，对小支气管主要为抑制其平滑肌的活动，因而使小支气管扩大，空气出入畅通。气喘患者在注射麻黄素等制剂后得到暂时缓解，即因此故。
(4)对泌尿系统的作用：交感神经的作用能使膀胱壁松弛，内括约肌收缩，因而阻止小便排出。
此外，在生殖系统中对女性子宫平滑肌，对男性射精管和精囊的平滑肌等都有调节作用。

###  Parasympathetic Nervous System

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems usually do opposite things in the body. The sympathetic nervous system prepares your body for physical and mental activity. It makes your heart beat faster and stronger, opens your airways so you can breathe more easily, and inhibits digestion.

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for bodily functions when we are at rest: it stimulates digestion, activates various metabolic processes and helps us to relax. But the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems do not always work in opposite directions; they sometimes complement each other too. 

副交感神经系统（Parasympathetic Division) 是植物性神经系统的主要部分，发自中脑、桥脑、延脑及脊髓的骶部。它的节前纤维在副交感神经节中交换神经元，再由此发出节后纤维，至平滑肌、心肌和腺体。副交感神经节一般位于脏器附近或脏器壁内。

交感神经和副交感神经在机能上具有拮抗性质。一般讲，人们把交感神经看成机体应付
紧急情况的机构。当人们挣扎、搏斗、恐惧和愤怒时，交感神经马上发生作用，它加速心脏的跳动；下令肝脏释放更多的血糖，使肌肉得以利用；暂时减缓或停止消化器官的活动，从而动员全身力量以应付危急。而副交感神经的作用则相反，它起着平衡作用，抑制体内各器官的过度兴奋，使它们获得心要的休息。 
副交感神经系统可保持身体在安静状态下的生理平衡，其作用有三个方面：

①增进胃肠的活动，消化腺的分泌，促进大小便的排出，保持身体的能量。  
②瞳孔缩小以减少刺激，促进肝糖原的生成，以储蓄能源。  
③心跳减慢，血压降低，支气管缩小，以节省不必要的消耗，协助生殖活动，如使生殖血管扩张，性器官分泌液增加。  

### subcortical structure

<img src="https://universe-review.ca/I10-13-subcortical.png">

The subcortical structures of the nervous system have complex motor and non-motor functions. They are situated beneath the cerebral cortex, and receive extensive inputs from it and the peripheral sense organs and stretch receptors. Through recurrent feedback loops, the information received is processed and integrated to provide an output that contributes to scaling, sequencing, and timing of movements, in addition to learning and automatization of motor and non-motor behavior.

The subcortical structures include: the limbic system, the diencephalon, and the ventricles.

### Brainstem

<img src="http://www.strokeeducation.info/images/brainstem%20and%20brain%20.jpg">

Brainstem, area at the base of the brain that lies between the deep structures of the cerebral hemispheres and the cervical spinal cord. The brainstem is divided into three sections in humans: the midbrain (mesencephalon), the pons (metencephalon), and the medulla oblongata (myelencephalon).

The brainstem houses many of the control centres for vital body functions, such as swallowing, breathing, and vasomotor control. All of the cranial nerve nuclei, except those associated with olfaction and vision, are located in the brainstem, providing motor and sensory function to structures of the cranium, including the facial muscles, tongue, pharynx, and larynx, as well as supplying the senses of taste, equilibrium, and hearing. The brainstem also has nuclei important for sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functions. All efferent and afferent pathways between the cerebrum and cerebellum course through the brainstem, and many of them decussate, or cross, within this structure.

脑干（brainstem）位于大脑下方，是大脑和脊髓之间的较小部分，呈不规则的柱状形。脑干自下而上由延髓、脑桥、中脑三部分组成。延髓部分下连脊髓。
脑干是脊髓向上延伸的部分,其下端与脊髓相连，上端与大脑相接。脑干自下面上可分为延髓、桥脑、中脑和间脑。
上面脑神经。脑干内的白质由上、下行的传导束，以及脑干各部所发出的神经纤维所构成。是大脑、小脑与脊髓相互联系的重要通路。脑干内的灰质分散成大小不等的灰质块，叫“神经核”。神经核与接受外围的传入冲动和传出冲动支配器官的活动，以及上行下行传导束的传导有关。此外，在延髓和脑桥里有调节心血管运动、呼吸、吞咽、呕吐等重要生理活动的反射中枢。若这些中枢受损伤，将引起心搏、血压的严重障碍，甚至危及生命。
延髓尾端在枕骨大孔处与脊髓接续，中脑头端与间脑相接。延髓和脑桥恰卧于颅底的斜坡上。
脑干的功能主要是维持个体生命，包括心跳、呼吸、消化等重要生理功能，均与脑干的功能有关。
经由脊髓传至脑的神经冲动，呈交叉方式进入。即左传右再入脑，右同理。

### cerebellum

<img src="https://anatomy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cerebellum.jpg">

The cerebellum is one of the most identifiable parts of the brain due to its unique shape and location. It is extremely important for being able to perform everyday voluntary (done with purpose and intent) tasks such as walking and writing. It is also essential to being able to stay balanced and upright. Patients who have suffered from damaged cerebellums often struggle with keeping their balance and maintaining proper muscle coordination.

### limbic system

<img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2-170324150315/95/anatomy-of-limbic-system-3-638.jpg">

The limbic system is comprised of telencephalic, diencephalic, and mesencephalic components that are located on both sides of the thalamus.

It includes the large subcallosal cingulate and parahippocampal gyri of the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, as well as the hippocampal formation formed by the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, the subicular complex and area 28 of the cortex. These structures are related to the terminations of the olfactory tracts in the frontal and medial temporal lobes.

The limbic system is also associated with the subcortical nuclei, which includes the amygdala, the septum, the hypothalamus, the habenula, the anterior thalamic nuclei and parts of the basal ganglia. It is involved in emotional and behavioral processes, motivation, long-term memory, and olfaction.

### Corpus Callosum 

<img src="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~Brainmd1/brmodelc.gif">

The Corpus Callosum is the part of the mind that allows communication between the two hemispheres of the brain. It is responsible for transmitting neural messages between both the right and left hemispheres. 

### amygdala

When you think of the amygdala, you should think of one word. Fear. The amygdala is the reason we are afraid of things outside our control. It also controls the way we react to certain stimuli, or an event that causes an emotion, that we see as potentially threatening or dangerous.

杏仁核，附着在海马的末端，呈杏仁状，是边缘系统的一部分。是产生情绪，识别情绪和调节情绪，控制学习和记忆的脑部组织，而且研究发现，幼儿自闭症似乎也与扩大的杏仁核有关。

刺激清醒动物的杏仁核，动物出现“停顿反应”，显得“高度注意”，表现迷惑、焦虑、恐惧、退缩反应或发怒、攻击反应。刺激杏仁首端引起逃避和恐惧，刺激杏仁尾端引起防御和攻击反应。诱发惧—怒反应时伴瞳孔扩大、竖毛、嗥叫等情绪表现。切除杏仁核，动物出现“心理性失明”：通过视觉看到的东西不知是否可以吃，必需放到嘴里才知道；“过度变态”：反复察看、触摸或以口检查各种物体，包括原先所畏惧的活蛇或活鼠；情感性行为发生显著变化或所有的情感反应完全丧失。关于情绪反应的产生机制，有人研究认为存在两条反射通路。（1）刺激—〉丘脑—〉扣带回—〉大脑各区域相应皮质（长通路）；（2）刺激—〉丘脑—〉杏仁核（短通路）。长通路的刺激信息经过皮质的精细加工，利于对情绪的控制和采取适当的应对方式，短通路的刺激信息未经皮质的精细加工，速度更快，保证对恐惧刺激作出迅速反应，这对包括人在内的所有生物的生存十分重要。由此可见，杏仁核的主要功能为产生和传入大脑新皮质的各种外界信息相适应的情绪。

杏仁核是情绪学习和记忆的重要结构。和海马一样，杏仁核对新异刺激出现朝向反应，破坏两侧杏仁核的动物，对新异视觉刺激的朝向反应大为降低，缺乏对恐惧事件的辨识和反应。相反，在杏仁核正常的情况下，当你听说邻居家的狗咬伤了人，见到狗后你会感到恐惧而早早避之，尽管你未曾被它咬过。具有情绪意义的刺激会引起杏仁核电活动的强烈反应，并形成长期的痕迹储存于脑中。因此，触动人情绪反应强烈的事件会给人留下长期的记忆，甚至终身.

### Hippocampus

The hippocampus has a unique shape, similar to that of a horseshoe. It not only assists with the storage of long term memories, but is also responsible for the memory of the location of objects or people. We would not even be able to remember where our house is without the work of the hippocampus. Alzheimer's disease, (a disease that effects elderly people and often results in loss of memory) has been proven to have affected and damaged this area of the brain. 

海马体（Hippocampus），又名海马回、海马区、大脑海马，海马体位于大脑丘脑和内侧颞叶之间，属于边缘系统的一部分，主要负责长时记忆的存储转换和定向等功能.

### Occipital Lobe

<img src="https://library.neura.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/frontal-lobe/Frontal-lobe.jpg">

The occiptial lobe is important to being able to correctly understand what your eyes are seeing. These lobes have to be very fast to process the rapid information that our eyes are sending. Similar to how the temporal lobe makes sense of auditory information, the occipital lobe makes sense of visual information so that we are able to understand it. If our occipital lobe was impaired, or injured we would not be able to correctly process visual signals, thus visual confusion would result.

枕叶（Occipital Lobe）是大脑皮层顶枕裂之后的部位。其距状裂两侧的纹区（第Ⅰ视区，或称17 区）是重要的视觉中枢，主要处理视觉信息，并控制同视觉有关的眼球运动和瞳孔调节的反射活动。刺激该区某一点，可在特定的视野区出现简单视象；刺激视网膜，可在纹皮质的单个细胞得到诱发反应。一侧枕叶皮质主要与两眼同侧的视网膜相联系，因而与两眼对侧的视野有关。

### Temporal Lobe

The Temporal Lobe mainly revolves around hearing and selective listening. It receives sensory information such as sounds and speech from the ears. It is also key to being able to comprehend, or understand meaningful speech. In fact, we would not be able to understand someone talking to us, if it wasn't for the temporal lobe. This lobe is special because it makes sense of the all the different sounds and pitches (different types of sound) being transmitted from the sensory receptors of the ears.

颞叶(niè yè) 位于外侧裂下方，由颞上沟和颞下沟分为颞上回、颞中回、颞下回。隐在外侧裂内的是颞横回。在颞叶的侧面和底面，在颞下沟和侧副裂间为梭状回，侧副裂与海马裂之间为海马回，围绕海马裂前端的钩状部分称为海马钩回。负责处理听觉信息，也与记忆和情感有关。

### Lateralization of brain function

<img src="http://slideplayer.com/slide/5363471/17/images/71/Lateralization+of+Cerebral+Functions.jpg" />

The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The medial longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human’s brain develops differently leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend since it has a stronger anthropological history.[1] The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness, however, meaning that the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere corresponding to the dominant hand (anatomically on the opposite side). Function lateralization such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, prosody, etc. has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres.[2] Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum this is the same bodyside, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.

### Broca's area



<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/700x450/32/99532-004-2B7BE4E6.jpg">

Broca area, also called convolution of Broca, region of the brain that contains neurons involved in speech function. This area, located in the frontal part of the left hemisphere of the brain, was discovered in 1861 by French surgeon Paul Broca, who found that it serves a vital role in the generation of articulate speech.

Damage to the frontal lobe can result in a speech disorder known as Broca aphasia, which is characterized by deliberate, telegraphic speech with very simple grammatical structure, though the speaker may be quite clear as to what he or she wishes to say and may communicate successfully.

布罗卡氏区 [1]  （Broca's area）又称布罗卡氏中枢、布罗卡氏回，即运动性言语中枢（说话中枢）。 布罗卡氏区的发现，不但使人想念神经系统内的机能各有其较特殊的定位，而且还找到了以脑沟回作为脑的机能分区的明确标志。

发现者为皮埃尔·保尔·布罗卡，法国外科医生、神经病理学家、人类学家，也是最早发现大脑左半球语言中枢的生理学家。

布罗卡氏区是大脑的一区，它主管语言讯息的处理、话语的产生。与韦尼克区Wernicke's area共同形成语言系统。布罗卡氏区与韦尼克区通常位于脑部的优势半脑(通常位于左侧)，这是由于大多数人(97%)是右利的缘故。布罗卡氏区与韦尼克区由额叶和颞叶间的神经通道弓状束(Arcuate fasciculus)连接。
布罗卡区位于主侧大脑半球额下后部靠近岛盖处，即布鲁德曼第 44、45 区。在布罗卡的发现之前，P.弗卢朗学说坚持大脑的整体功能。布罗卡氏区损害导致运动性失语症，由于有关肌肉共济失调，不能将语言以口语方式表达出来。障碍程度轻重不等。轻者找到个合适的词，重复使用有限的词汇，句子简单，语法单调，表达中有较长的停顿。重者言语功能丧失，能发音，但构成不了词句。

### Wernicke area

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u4QwjrE7Ji4/hqdefault.jpg">

Wernicke area, region of the brain that contains motor neurons involved in the comprehension of speech. This area was first described in 1874 by German neurologist Carl Wernicke. The Wernicke area is located in the posterior third of the upper temporal convolution of the left hemisphere of the brain. Thus, it lies close to the auditory cortex. This area appears to be uniquely important for the comprehension of speech sounds and is considered to be the receptive language, or language comprehension, centre.

Damage to the temporal lobe may result in a language disorder known as Wernicke aphasia. An individual with Wernicke aphasia has difficulty understanding language; speech is typically fluent but is empty of content and characterized by circumlocutions, a high incidence of vague words like “thing,” and sometimes neologisms and senseless “word salad.”

1874年德国医生韦尼克发现左半球有一个不同于布洛卡区的重要的语言区域，可以控制语言理解的技能。韦尼克区（又称威尼克区、沃尼克区）是大脑写中枢，视觉性语言中枢，是神经心理学重要学术名词。在心理语言学领域也多有提及。

###  The Parietal Lobe 

The parietal lobe carries out some very specific functions. As a part of the cortex, it has a lot of responsibilities and has to be able to process sensory information within seconds. The parietal lobe is where information such as taste, temperature and touch are integrated, or processed. Humans would not be able to to feel sensations of touch, if the parietal lobe was damaged.

顶叶（parietal lobe），大脑半球中部部分。其外侧面的前界是中央沟，后界是顶枕沟和由此沟末端到枕前切迹间的连线，下界为外侧裂向后至顶枕线的延线。与之下缘平行的顶间沟，将其除后中央回以外的部分分为顶上小叶和顶下小叶。顶下小叶包括围绕外侧裂末端的缘上回和围绕颞上沟末端的角回。缘上回为运动中枢，角回在优势半球为阅读中枢。后中央回为感觉中枢。顶上小叶为实体觉分析区。内侧面有旁中央小叶的后半部和楔前回。旁中央小叶是管理膀胱和直肠的中枢。与额、颞、枕叶、Rolando运动区、扣带回发生联系，通过胼胝体与对侧顶叶发生联系。发出纤维到丘脑，也接受来自丘脑的纤维。病变时，可出现感觉、知觉障碍，体象障碍，空间定向障碍，结构性失用症等。

有研究表明，人的顶叶的大小在一定程度下与数学和逻辑方面能力的大小有关，一般成正比，即顶叶后区体积越大，一个人在数学，逻辑思维，发散思维等方面的能力越强（如爱因斯坦等，他的顶叶比一般人大百分之二十左右，盲人的顶叶也比一般人的大），顶叶前区越大，人的身体协调性，感觉等越发达。顶叶大小也与一个人的寿命长度和躯体平衡、协调性在一定程度上有关。

### Sensory  Strips

<img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/myers10e-ls-ch02-1-140304181623-phpapp01/95/myers10e-lsch021-54-638.jpg">

The sensory strip is apart of the brain located in the parietal lobe, near the border of the frontal lobe. 
The sensory strip is involved in registering sensation that are connected specific body parts or body functions. 

It is the band of neurons that are embedded in your cerebrum or cerebral cortex .

### Motor Strips

Motor strips, which are located in the frontal lobeis what control all muscle movement including the ones that are necessary for speech. 

### somatosensory map

<img src="http://mybrainnotes.com/brain-homunculus.jpg">

Sensory maps are areas of the brain which respond to sensory stimulation, and are spatially organized according to some feature of the sensory stimulation. In some cases the sensory map is simply a topographic representation of a sensory surface such as the skin, cochlea, or retina. In other cases it represents other stimulus properties resulting from neuronal computation and is generally ordered in a manner that reflects the periphery. An example is the somatosensory map which is a projection of the skin's surface in the brain that arranges the processing of tactile sensation. This type of somatotopic map is the most common, possibly because it allows for physically neighboring areas of the brain to react to physically similar stimuli in the periphery or because it allows for greater motor control.

The somatosensory cortex is adjacent to the primary motor cortex which is similarly mapped. Sensory maps may play an important role in facilitating motor responses. Other examples of sensory map organization may be that adjacent brain regions are related through proximity of the receptors that they process as in the map of the cochlea in the brain, or that similar features are processed as in the map of the feature detectors or the retinotopic map, or that time codes are used in organization as in the maps of an owl's sense of direction via interaural time difference between ears. These examples exist in contrast to non-mapped or randomly distributed patterns of processing. An example of a non-mapped sensory processing system is the olfactory system where unrelated odorants are processed side-by-side in the olfactory bulb. In addition to non-mapped and mapped processing, stimuli may be processed under multiple maps as in the human visual system.

### Cortical homunculus

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b3/d3/07/b3d3077e179d953ef6eb813ce31236f7.jpg">

A cortical homunculus is a distorted representation of the human body, based on a neurological "map" of the areas and proportions of the human brain dedicated to processing motor functions, or sensory functions, for different parts of the body. The word homunculus is Latin for "little man", and was a term used in alchemy and folklore long before scientific literature began using it. A cortical homunculus, or "cortex man", illustrates the concept of heuristically representing the body lying within the brain. Nerve fibres from the spinal cord terminate in various areas of the parietal lobe in the cerebral cortex, which forms a representational map of the body.

### Proprioception

Proprioception: The ability to sense stimuli arising within the body regarding position, motion, and equilibrium. Even if a person is blindfolded, he or she knows through proprioception if an arm is above the head or hanging by the side of the body. The sense of proprioception is disturbed in many neurological disorders. It can sometimes be improved through the use of sensory integration therapy, a type of specialized occupational therapy.

本体感觉是指肌、腱、关节等运动器官本身在不同状态（运动或静止）时产生的感觉（例如，人在闭眼时能感知身体各部的位置）。因位置较深，又称深部感觉。此外，在本体感觉传导通路中，还传导皮肤的精细触觉（如辨别两点距离和物体的纹理粗细等）。主要涉及躯干和四肢的本体感觉传导通路（属于顶叶功能）。

### The Frontal Lobe 

You use your frontal lobe nearly everyday. You use it to make decisions, such as what to eat or drink for breakfast in the morning, as well as for thinking or studying for a test. The frontal lobe is also where our personality is formed and where we can carry out higher mental processes such as planning. In addition, the frontal lobe is necessary to being able to speak fluently (without fault) and meaningfully. 

The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain and is associated with reasoning, motor skills, higher level cognition, and expressive language. At the back of the frontal lobe, near the central sulcus, lies the motor cortex. This area of the brain receives information from various lobes of the brain and utilizes this information to carry out body movements. Damage to the frontal lobe can lead to changes in sexual habits, socialization, and attention as well as increased risk-taking.

额叶（Frontal Lobe）是脊椎动物的脑的一部分，位于脑的前半部（顶叶前方、颞叶上方），在人类大脑当中，比起其余脑中的“叶”，这是最大的一部分，而有些动物的脑几乎不存在额叶。

这个结构和人类语语言的形成、语言表达（布若卡氏区）、自主意识以及随意肌的控制有关。额叶负责人们的思维、计划功能，还与情感相关；大脑额叶是“执行功能”之所在，“执行功能”是一种比较高级的思维，包括决策、多任务处理和提前计划。

### frontal lobotomy

A neurosurgical procedure wherein the connections to and from the brain’s prefrontal cortex are cut. This procedure was performed to try and neautralize the mentally ill. The man responsible for this technique was named Walter Freeman.

脑叶白质切除术（lobotomy）是一种切除脑前额叶外皮的连接组织的神经外科手术，亦称脑白质切除术、脑叶切断术等。脑白质切除术在1930年~1950年主要被用来医治一些精神疾病，这亦是世界上第一种精神外科手术。治疗客体包括精神分裂症、临床抑郁症及部分忧虑紊乱症，还包括一些被人们认为有精神疾病征象（如喜怒无常、年少轻狂）的人。病人术后很可能患上精神幼稚病。

现在对前脑叶白质切除术所做出的评价一般都是负面的，这主要是因为在当时的简陋条件下，对大脑所实施的手术精度很低，对术后效果的评价也没有客观、可信的标准。而且手术对象在经过手术后往往丧失精神冲动，表现出类似痴呆、弱智的迹象。一些文学和影视作品，如《飞越疯人院》，《1984》将前脑叶白质切除术描述成使人丧失反抗意识的手术。1950年左右所做出的调查表明，大约有三分之一的病例在手术后没有多少变化，另外三分之一比术前还有所恶化。而这三分之一则变得更为冲动乃至于丧失社会性且更为残暴，丧失人性。随着后来药物治疗的发展和其他更精确脑外科手术的发展，前脑叶白质切除术在20世纪70年代以后逐渐被抛弃，或者被改进以在更精确的条件下用来治疗癫痫等疾病。

### Split-brain

As you may know, the human brain has two halves; a right half and a left half. Information is able to travel from one half to the other br crossing a bridge known as the corpus callosum. However, split brain refers to the situation in which the connections between the halves of the brain are severed...basically the bridge is cut. Although there are some abilities that are lost by severing the connection between the halves, people are able to function quite well.

### Corpus callosum

<img src="https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/callosumhemispheres600.png">

The Corpus Callosum is the part of the mind that allows communication between the two hemispheres of the brain. It is responsible for transmitting neural messages between both the right and left hemispheres. 

胼胝体（拉丁语：Corpus callosum）是哺乳动物大脑的一个重要白质带。它连接大脑的左右两个半球。胼胝体是大脑最大的白质带，其中约包含2-2.5亿个神经纤维。大脑两半球间的通信多数是通过胼胝体进行的。较为低级的脊椎动物，例如单孔目和有袋类的动物没有胼胝体。
