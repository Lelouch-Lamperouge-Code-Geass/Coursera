### Brain

<img src="http://thefactfile-lxh7vfdm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Brain-facts-Infographics-1.png">

Brain weighs about three pounds which is about 2% of our total body weight.  Now, in fact, if you compare this to other animals, that's actually a very  high, what we call brain to body ratio. We have the biggest brain of any animal  relative to the size of our body. other animals like whales and such  obviously have bigger brains, but they have bigger bodies as well.  So, at 2%, we have the largest brain to body ratio.  but the really interesting thing is the brain is only 2% of the body, but look at  the resources it consumes. 25% of our oxygen so one of every four  breaths you take goes to your brain, as a way of thinking about it.  70% of the body's glucose supply, blood sugars goes to the brain.  So, the brain is a very sugar hungry organ in the body.  and 25% of the nutrients you eat go towards keeping your brain healthy.  So, despite its relatively small size in the body, it clearly is, a  really powerful, powerful organ that's critical to our survival.  there are about a 100 billion neurons, but perhaps more important than the, the  number of neurons are the number of connections between these neurons, 1  quadrillion. So, million, billion, trillion,  quadrillion. so there's a lot of connections, and  that's really where the brain gets its computational power.  The neurons themselves are relatively simplistic, as you'll see, and actually  transmit information in a relatively slow way.  A common copper wire transmits information much more quickly than brain  tissue does. but what the brain has is this tightly  interconnected web of connections. 

### White Matter

White matter is usually found in the deeper tissues of the brain and contains those nerve fibers that have extensions of the nerve cell. These nerve cells have a covering around them to protect the axons, and the reason behind white colour is due to the myelin sheath that not only acts as a coating but also gives the uniqueness to such matter. It increases the speed of transmission and helps the brains move stronger whenever a minor or major injury takes place. It also comes with some basic damage precautions; mostly it happens in people at a young age and gets known as the white matter disorders. Diagnosing of this issue can be helped by MRI scans which tell about the problem and different tissue levels. The most basic caution of something not going well is that the myelin sheath is not grown properly so it does help to protect the parts of brain.  At earlier stages, people thought that it does not have any especial concern in the brain and that is why no research was done to know the exact issue. Among the two matters present in the spinal cord this one is the fastest and help in connecting others parts, so they stay in touch.

### Grey Matter

Grey Matter is defined as the major component of the human brain that has different nucleon bodies, neuropil, and some other parts that help in working on different body parts. Grey matter is more important of two matters present in brain and comes with different functions. It has become the focus of advanced research and that is why few new things are coming up. The type of fat that is present within the myelin sheath but for the grey matter, the actual colour produced from the cell structures of neurons and the brain cells that are called as glial cells. These types of cells provide energy and nutrition to the neurons, that’s how grey colour became part of the system. Most of the times it gets known as the neurons and other different cells present in the central nervous system and is part of brain, brainstem, cerebellum and inside the spinal cord.

### White matter vs Grey matter

<img src="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/18117.jpg">

* White matter comprises mainly  of myelinated axons, also called tracts while grey matter few myelinated axons.  
* White matter gets it light color because of  the lipid content of myelin while grey matter actually gets it grey pinkish color  from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.  
* Grey matter contains most of the neuron somas while white matter is made up mostly of myelinated axons.  
* Grey matter is made up of nerve cell bodies, and white matter is made up of fibers.  
* Neurons of white matter has extended axons while grey matter neurons don’t.  
* Grey matter occupy 40% of the brain while white matter occupies 60%  
* Gray matter reaches it highest point of development in a person furing their twenties, the white matter  develop throughout your twenties and peaks in middle age.  

### Neuron

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Neuron.svg/1280px-Neuron.svg.png">

Neurons (also called neurones or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. More than that, their interactions define who we are as people. Having said that, our roughly 100 billion neurons do interact closely with other cell types, broadly classified as glia (these may actually outnumber neurons, although it’s not really known).

<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eJpbb.gif">

Neurons send signals to other neurons via specialized contacts known as synapses. The most common type of synapse in the nervous system is known as a chemical synapse. Typically a chemical synapse occurs between the axon terminal of the neuron sending the message, and the dendrite of the neuron receiving the message. The neuron sending the message is known as the presynaptic cell and the one receiving the message is the postsynaptic cell. In a chemical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell don’t actually touch each other, but are separated by a very tiny gap known as a synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is only 20 nanometers wide. This is teeny. In comparison, a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers thick. What a chemical synapse does, is it transforms an electrical signal (which is the action potential in the presynaptic cell’s axon) into a chemical signal (which is the neurotrasmitter) and back to an electrical signal (the postsynaptic potential) in the postsynaptic cell.

### axon

An axon, or nerve fiber, is a long slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body or soma.

Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they help make up nerves.

Individual axons are microscopic in diameter - typically about one micrometre across - but may extend to macroscopic lengths.

The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spine to the big toe of each foot.

These single-cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer.

In vertebrates, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in myelin, which is formed by either of two types of glial cells: Schwann cells ensheathing peripheral neurons and oligodendrocytes insulating those of the central nervous system.

### central nervous system

<img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/pmh/PMH_Authoring/media/Images/medium_thumbs/N00879_L.jpg">  

The nervous system is made up of all the nerve cells in your body. It is through the nervous system that we communicate with the outside world and, at the same time, many mechanisms inside our body are controlled. The nervous system takes in information through our senses, processes the information and triggers reactions, such as making your muscles move or causing you to feel pain. For example, if you touch a hot plate, you reflexively pull back your hand and your nerves simultaneously send pain signals to your brain. Metabolic processes are also controlled by the nervous system.

There are many billions of nerve cells, also called neurons, in the nervous system. The brain alone has about 100 billion neurons in it. Each neuron has a cell body and various extensions. The shorter extensions (called dendrites) act like antennae: they receive signals from, for example, other neurons and pass them on to the cell body. The signals are then passed on via a long extension (the axon), which can be up to a meter long.

The nervous system has two parts, called the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system due to their location in the body. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It is safely contained within the skull and vertebral canal of the spine. All of the other nerves in the body are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

### peripheral nervous system

<img src="https://www.nf2is.org/nf_img/cnspns.png">

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the division of the nervous system containing all the nerves that lie outside of the central nervous system (CNS). The primary role of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the organs, limbs, and skin. These nerves extend from the central nervous system to the outermost areas of the body. The peripheral system allows the brain and spinal cord to receive and send information to other areas of the body, which allows us to react to stimuli in our environment.

The nerves that make up the peripheral nervous system are actually the axons or bundles of axons from neuron cells. In some cases, these nerves are very small but some nerve bundles are so large that they can be easily seen by the human eye.

The peripheral nervous system itself is divided into two parts:

* The somatic nervous system
* The autonomic nervous system

Each of these components plays a critical role in how the peripheral nervous system operates.  

### The Somatic Nervous System

The somatic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for carrying sensory and motor information to and from the central nervous system.


The __somatic nervous system__ derives its name from the Greek word soma, which means "body."

The __somatic system__ is responsible for transmitting sensory information as well as for voluntary movement. This system contains two major types of neurons:

* Sensory neurons (or afferent neurons) that carry information from the nerves to the central nervous system. It is these sensory neurons that allow us to take in sensory information and send it to the brain and spinal cord.   
* Motor neurons (or efferent neurons) that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to muscle fibers throughout the body. These motor neurons allow us to take physical action in response to stimuli in the environment.  

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The autonomic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for regulating involuntary body functions, such as blood flow, heartbeat, digestion, and breathing. In other words, it is the autonomic system that controls aspects of the body that are usually not under voluntary control. This system allows these functions to take place without needing to consciously think about them happening.

This system is further divided into two branches:

* The sympathetic system regulates the flight-or-fight responses. This system prepares the body to expend energy and deal with potential threats in the environment. When action is needed, the sympathetic system will trigger a response by speeding up the heart rate, increasing breathing rate, increasing blood flow to muscles, activating sweat secretion, and dilating the pupils. This allows the body to respond quickly in situations that require immediate action. In some cases, we might stay and fight the threat, while in other cases we may instead flee from the danger.  
* The parasympathetic system helps maintain normal body functions and conserve physical resources. Once a threat has passed, this system will slow the heart rate, slow breathing, reduce blood flow to muscles, and constrict the pupils. This allows us to return our bodies to a normal resting state.  

### Sympathetic Nervous System

<img src="http://activateanddominate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/para_sympathetic.jpg">

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems usually do opposite things in the body. The sympathetic nervous system prepares your body for physical and mental activity. It makes your heart beat faster and stronger, opens your airways so you can breathe more easily, and inhibits digestion.

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for bodily functions when we are at rest: it stimulates digestion, activates various metabolic processes and helps us to relax. But the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems do not always work in opposite directions; they sometimes complement each other too. 

交感神经 sympathetic nerve： 的低级中枢位于脊髓胸1～腰2或腰3节段的灰质侧柱的中间带外侧核。交感神经节前纤维起自此核的细胞，因此交感神经又称交感部或胸腰部。
交感神经的周围部包括交感干、交感神经节，以及由节发出的分支和交感神经丛等，根据交感神经节所在位置不同，又可分为椎旁节和椎前节。
活动比较广泛，刺激交感神经能引起腹腔内脏及皮肤末梢血管收缩、心搏加强和加速、新陈代谢亢进、瞳孔散大、疲乏的肌肉工作能力增加等。交感神经的活动主要保证人体紧张状态时的生理需要。
(1)对循环系统的作用：皮肤和横纹肌以及腹腔脏器的血管只接受交感神经的支配，冠状循环以及脑循环的血管都同时接受交感和副交感两种神经纤维，因此，刺 激交感神经一般可使周围动脉收缩，而在去除交感神经后可使周围动脉扩张。治疗周围血管疾患，施行交感神经切除术，即以此为依据。
(2) 对消化系统的作用：交感神经对胃肠道的作用主要是抑制，使蠕动减慢，但当胃肠紧张性太低或不活动时，交感神经冲动则可以提高并兴奋之。对消化腺的分泌功 能，交感神经的作用甚不一致，对胰和唾液腺虽可促进其分泌，但因此部的血管收缩而分泌不明显，对胃液则阻止其分泌。
(3)对呼吸系统的作用：交感神经兴奋时，对小支气管主要为抑制其平滑肌的活动，因而使小支气管扩大，空气出入畅通。气喘患者在注射麻黄素等制剂后得到暂时缓解，即因此故。
(4)对泌尿系统的作用：交感神经的作用能使膀胱壁松弛，内括约肌收缩，因而阻止小便排出。
此外，在生殖系统中对女性子宫平滑肌，对男性射精管和精囊的平滑肌等都有调节作用。

###  Parasympathetic Nervous System

The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems usually do opposite things in the body. The sympathetic nervous system prepares your body for physical and mental activity. It makes your heart beat faster and stronger, opens your airways so you can breathe more easily, and inhibits digestion.

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for bodily functions when we are at rest: it stimulates digestion, activates various metabolic processes and helps us to relax. But the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems do not always work in opposite directions; they sometimes complement each other too. 

副交感神经系统（Parasympathetic Division) 是植物性神经系统的主要部分，发自中脑、桥脑、延脑及脊髓的骶部。它的节前纤维在副交感神经节中交换神经元，再由此发出节后纤维，至平滑肌、心肌和腺体。副交感神经节一般位于脏器附近或脏器壁内。

交感神经和副交感神经在机能上具有拮抗性质。一般讲，人们把交感神经看成机体应付
紧急情况的机构。当人们挣扎、搏斗、恐惧和愤怒时，交感神经马上发生作用，它加速心脏的跳动；下令肝脏释放更多的血糖，使肌肉得以利用；暂时减缓或停止消化器官的活动，从而动员全身力量以应付危急。而副交感神经的作用则相反，它起着平衡作用，抑制体内各器官的过度兴奋，使它们获得心要的休息。 
副交感神经系统可保持身体在安静状态下的生理平衡，其作用有三个方面：

①增进胃肠的活动，消化腺的分泌，促进大小便的排出，保持身体的能量。  
②瞳孔缩小以减少刺激，促进肝糖原的生成，以储蓄能源。  
③心跳减慢，血压降低，支气管缩小，以节省不必要的消耗，协助生殖活动，如使生殖血管扩张，性器官分泌液增加。  

### subcortical structure

<img src="https://universe-review.ca/I10-13-subcortical.png">

The subcortical structures of the nervous system have complex motor and non-motor functions. They are situated beneath the cerebral cortex, and receive extensive inputs from it and the peripheral sense organs and stretch receptors. Through recurrent feedback loops, the information received is processed and integrated to provide an output that contributes to scaling, sequencing, and timing of movements, in addition to learning and automatization of motor and non-motor behavior.

The subcortical structures include: the limbic system, the diencephalon, and the ventricles.

### Brainstem

<img src="http://www.strokeeducation.info/images/brainstem%20and%20brain%20.jpg">

Brainstem, area at the base of the brain that lies between the deep structures of the cerebral hemispheres and the cervical spinal cord. The brainstem is divided into three sections in humans: the midbrain (mesencephalon), the pons (metencephalon), and the medulla oblongata (myelencephalon).

The brainstem houses many of the control centres for vital body functions, such as swallowing, breathing, and vasomotor control. All of the cranial nerve nuclei, except those associated with olfaction and vision, are located in the brainstem, providing motor and sensory function to structures of the cranium, including the facial muscles, tongue, pharynx, and larynx, as well as supplying the senses of taste, equilibrium, and hearing. The brainstem also has nuclei important for sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functions. All efferent and afferent pathways between the cerebrum and cerebellum course through the brainstem, and many of them decussate, or cross, within this structure.

脑干（brainstem）位于大脑下方，是大脑和脊髓之间的较小部分，呈不规则的柱状形。脑干自下而上由延髓、脑桥、中脑三部分组成。延髓部分下连脊髓。
脑干是脊髓向上延伸的部分,其下端与脊髓相连，上端与大脑相接。脑干自下面上可分为延髓、桥脑、中脑和间脑。
上面脑神经。脑干内的白质由上、下行的传导束，以及脑干各部所发出的神经纤维所构成。是大脑、小脑与脊髓相互联系的重要通路。脑干内的灰质分散成大小不等的灰质块，叫“神经核”。神经核与接受外围的传入冲动和传出冲动支配器官的活动，以及上行下行传导束的传导有关。此外，在延髓和脑桥里有调节心血管运动、呼吸、吞咽、呕吐等重要生理活动的反射中枢。若这些中枢受损伤，将引起心搏、血压的严重障碍，甚至危及生命。
延髓尾端在枕骨大孔处与脊髓接续，中脑头端与间脑相接。延髓和脑桥恰卧于颅底的斜坡上。
脑干的功能主要是维持个体生命，包括心跳、呼吸、消化等重要生理功能，均与脑干的功能有关。
经由脊髓传至脑的神经冲动，呈交叉方式进入。即左传右再入脑，右同理。

### cerebellum

<img src="https://anatomy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cerebellum.jpg">

The cerebellum is one of the most identifiable parts of the brain due to its unique shape and location. It is extremely important for being able to perform everyday voluntary (done with purpose and intent) tasks such as walking and writing. It is also essential to being able to stay balanced and upright. Patients who have suffered from damaged cerebellums often struggle with keeping their balance and maintaining proper muscle coordination.

### limbic system

<img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/2-170324150315/95/anatomy-of-limbic-system-3-638.jpg">

The limbic system is comprised of telencephalic, diencephalic, and mesencephalic components that are located on both sides of the thalamus.

It includes the large subcallosal cingulate and parahippocampal gyri of the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, as well as the hippocampal formation formed by the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, the subicular complex and area 28 of the cortex. These structures are related to the terminations of the olfactory tracts in the frontal and medial temporal lobes.

The limbic system is also associated with the subcortical nuclei, which includes the amygdala, the septum, the hypothalamus, the habenula, the anterior thalamic nuclei and parts of the basal ganglia. It is involved in emotional and behavioral processes, motivation, long-term memory, and olfaction.

### Corpus Callosum 

<img src="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~Brainmd1/brmodelc.gif">

The Corpus Callosum is the part of the mind that allows communication between the two hemispheres of the brain. It is responsible for transmitting neural messages between both the right and left hemispheres. 

### amygdala

When you think of the amygdala, you should think of one word. Fear. The amygdala is the reason we are afraid of things outside our control. It also controls the way we react to certain stimuli, or an event that causes an emotion, that we see as potentially threatening or dangerous.

杏仁核，附着在海马的末端，呈杏仁状，是边缘系统的一部分。是产生情绪，识别情绪和调节情绪，控制学习和记忆的脑部组织，而且研究发现，幼儿自闭症似乎也与扩大的杏仁核有关。

刺激清醒动物的杏仁核，动物出现“停顿反应”，显得“高度注意”，表现迷惑、焦虑、恐惧、退缩反应或发怒、攻击反应。刺激杏仁首端引起逃避和恐惧，刺激杏仁尾端引起防御和攻击反应。诱发惧—怒反应时伴瞳孔扩大、竖毛、嗥叫等情绪表现。切除杏仁核，动物出现“心理性失明”：通过视觉看到的东西不知是否可以吃，必需放到嘴里才知道；“过度变态”：反复察看、触摸或以口检查各种物体，包括原先所畏惧的活蛇或活鼠；情感性行为发生显著变化或所有的情感反应完全丧失。关于情绪反应的产生机制，有人研究认为存在两条反射通路。（1）刺激—〉丘脑—〉扣带回—〉大脑各区域相应皮质（长通路）；（2）刺激—〉丘脑—〉杏仁核（短通路）。长通路的刺激信息经过皮质的精细加工，利于对情绪的控制和采取适当的应对方式，短通路的刺激信息未经皮质的精细加工，速度更快，保证对恐惧刺激作出迅速反应，这对包括人在内的所有生物的生存十分重要。由此可见，杏仁核的主要功能为产生和传入大脑新皮质的各种外界信息相适应的情绪。

杏仁核是情绪学习和记忆的重要结构。和海马一样，杏仁核对新异刺激出现朝向反应，破坏两侧杏仁核的动物，对新异视觉刺激的朝向反应大为降低，缺乏对恐惧事件的辨识和反应。相反，在杏仁核正常的情况下，当你听说邻居家的狗咬伤了人，见到狗后你会感到恐惧而早早避之，尽管你未曾被它咬过。具有情绪意义的刺激会引起杏仁核电活动的强烈反应，并形成长期的痕迹储存于脑中。因此，触动人情绪反应强烈的事件会给人留下长期的记忆，甚至终身.

### Hippocampus

The hippocampus has a unique shape, similar to that of a horseshoe. It not only assists with the storage of long term memories, but is also responsible for the memory of the location of objects or people. We would not even be able to remember where our house is without the work of the hippocampus. Alzheimer's disease, (a disease that effects elderly people and often results in loss of memory) has been proven to have affected and damaged this area of the brain. 

海马体（Hippocampus），又名海马回、海马区、大脑海马，海马体位于大脑丘脑和内侧颞叶之间，属于边缘系统的一部分，主要负责长时记忆的存储转换和定向等功能.

### Occipital Lobe

<img src="https://library.neura.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/frontal-lobe/Frontal-lobe.jpg">

The occiptial lobe is important to being able to correctly understand what your eyes are seeing. These lobes have to be very fast to process the rapid information that our eyes are sending. Similar to how the temporal lobe makes sense of auditory information, the occipital lobe makes sense of visual information so that we are able to understand it. If our occipital lobe was impaired, or injured we would not be able to correctly process visual signals, thus visual confusion would result.

枕叶（Occipital Lobe）是大脑皮层顶枕裂之后的部位。其距状裂两侧的纹区（第Ⅰ视区，或称17 区）是重要的视觉中枢，主要处理视觉信息，并控制同视觉有关的眼球运动和瞳孔调节的反射活动。刺激该区某一点，可在特定的视野区出现简单视象；刺激视网膜，可在纹皮质的单个细胞得到诱发反应。一侧枕叶皮质主要与两眼同侧的视网膜相联系，因而与两眼对侧的视野有关。

### Temporal Lobe

The Temporal Lobe mainly revolves around hearing and selective listening. It receives sensory information such as sounds and speech from the ears. It is also key to being able to comprehend, or understand meaningful speech. In fact, we would not be able to understand someone talking to us, if it wasn't for the temporal lobe. This lobe is special because it makes sense of the all the different sounds and pitches (different types of sound) being transmitted from the sensory receptors of the ears.

颞叶(niè yè) 位于外侧裂下方，由颞上沟和颞下沟分为颞上回、颞中回、颞下回。隐在外侧裂内的是颞横回。在颞叶的侧面和底面，在颞下沟和侧副裂间为梭状回，侧副裂与海马裂之间为海马回，围绕海马裂前端的钩状部分称为海马钩回。负责处理听觉信息，也与记忆和情感有关。

### Lateralization of brain function

<img src="http://images.slideplayer.com/14/4280948/slides/slide_43.jpg">

The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The medial longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human’s brain develops differently leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend since it has a stronger anthropological history.[1] The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. These areas frequently correspond to handedness, however, meaning that the localization of these areas is regularly found on the hemisphere corresponding to the dominant hand (anatomically on the opposite side). Function lateralization such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, prosody, etc. has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres.[2] Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum this is the same bodyside, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.
