### Brain

<img src="http://thefactfile-lxh7vfdm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Brain-facts-Infographics-1.png">

Brain weighs about three pounds which is about 2% of our total body weight.  Now, in fact, if you compare this to other animals, that's actually a very  high, what we call brain to body ratio. We have the biggest brain of any animal  relative to the size of our body. other animals like whales and such  obviously have bigger brains, but they have bigger bodies as well.  So, at 2%, we have the largest brain to body ratio.  but the really interesting thing is the brain is only 2% of the body, but look at  the resources it consumes. 25% of our oxygen so one of every four  breaths you take goes to your brain, as a way of thinking about it.  70% of the body's glucose supply, blood sugars goes to the brain.  So, the brain is a very sugar hungry organ in the body.  and 25% of the nutrients you eat go towards keeping your brain healthy.  So, despite its relatively small size in the body, it clearly is, a  really powerful, powerful organ that's critical to our survival.  there are about a 100 billion neurons, but perhaps more important than the, the  number of neurons are the number of connections between these neurons, 1  quadrillion. So, million, billion, trillion,  quadrillion. so there's a lot of connections, and  that's really where the brain gets its computational power.  The neurons themselves are relatively simplistic, as you'll see, and actually  transmit information in a relatively slow way.  A common copper wire transmits information much more quickly than brain  tissue does. but what the brain has is this tightly  interconnected web of connections. 

### White Matter

White matter is usually found in the deeper tissues of the brain and contains those nerve fibers that have extensions of the nerve cell. These nerve cells have a covering around them to protect the axons, and the reason behind white colour is due to the myelin sheath that not only acts as a coating but also gives the uniqueness to such matter. It increases the speed of transmission and helps the brains move stronger whenever a minor or major injury takes place. It also comes with some basic damage precautions; mostly it happens in people at a young age and gets known as the white matter disorders. Diagnosing of this issue can be helped by MRI scans which tell about the problem and different tissue levels. The most basic caution of something not going well is that the myelin sheath is not grown properly so it does help to protect the parts of brain.  At earlier stages, people thought that it does not have any especial concern in the brain and that is why no research was done to know the exact issue. Among the two matters present in the spinal cord this one is the fastest and help in connecting others parts, so they stay in touch.

### Grey Matter

Grey Matter is defined as the major component of the human brain that has different nucleon bodies, neuropil, and some other parts that help in working on different body parts. Grey matter is more important of two matters present in brain and comes with different functions. It has become the focus of advanced research and that is why few new things are coming up. The type of fat that is present within the myelin sheath but for the grey matter, the actual colour produced from the cell structures of neurons and the brain cells that are called as glial cells. These types of cells provide energy and nutrition to the neurons, that’s how grey colour became part of the system. Most of the times it gets known as the neurons and other different cells present in the central nervous system and is part of brain, brainstem, cerebellum and inside the spinal cord.

### White matter vs Grey matter

* White matter comprises mainly  of myelinated axons, also called tracts while grey matter few myelinated axons.  
* White matter gets it light color because of  the lipid content of myelin while grey matter actually gets it grey pinkish color  from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.  
* Grey matter contains most of the neuron somas while white matter is made up mostly of myelinated axons.  
* Grey matter is made up of nerve cell bodies, and white matter is made up of fibers.  
* Neurons of white matter has extended axons while grey matter neurons don’t.  
* Grey matter occupy 40% of the brain while white matter occupies 60%  
* Gray matter reaches it highest point of development in a person furing their twenties, the white matter  develop throughout your twenties and peaks in middle age.  

### Neuron

Neurons (also called neurones or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. More than that, their interactions define who we are as people. Having said that, our roughly 100 billion neurons do interact closely with other cell types, broadly classified as glia (these may actually outnumber neurons, although it’s not really known).

Neurons send signals to other neurons via specialized contacts known as synapses. The most common type of synapse in the nervous system is known as a chemical synapse. Typically a chemical synapse occurs between the axon terminal of the neuron sending the message, and the dendrite of the neuron receiving the message. The neuron sending the message is known as the presynaptic cell and the one receiving the message is the postsynaptic cell. In a chemical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell don’t actually touch each other, but are separated by a very tiny gap known as a synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is only 20 nanometers wide. This is teeny. In comparison, a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers thick. What a chemical synapse does, is it transforms an electrical signal (which is the action potential in the presynaptic cell’s axon) into a chemical signal (which is the neurotrasmitter) and back to an electrical signal (the postsynaptic potential) in the postsynaptic cell.

### axon

An axon, or nerve fiber, is a long slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body or soma.

Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they help make up nerves.

Individual axons are microscopic in diameter - typically about one micrometre across - but may extend to macroscopic lengths.

The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spine to the big toe of each foot.

These single-cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer.

In vertebrates, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in myelin, which is formed by either of two types of glial cells: Schwann cells ensheathing peripheral neurons and oligodendrocytes insulating those of the central nervous system.
