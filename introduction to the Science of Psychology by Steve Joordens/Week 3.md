### Brain

<img src="http://thefactfile-lxh7vfdm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Brain-facts-Infographics-1.png">

Brain weighs about three pounds which is about 2% of our total body weight.  Now, in fact, if you compare this to other animals, that's actually a very  high, what we call brain to body ratio. We have the biggest brain of any animal  relative to the size of our body. other animals like whales and such  obviously have bigger brains, but they have bigger bodies as well.  So, at 2%, we have the largest brain to body ratio.  but the really interesting thing is the brain is only 2% of the body, but look at  the resources it consumes. 25% of our oxygen so one of every four  breaths you take goes to your brain, as a way of thinking about it.  70% of the body's glucose supply, blood sugars goes to the brain.  So, the brain is a very sugar hungry organ in the body.  and 25% of the nutrients you eat go towards keeping your brain healthy.  So, despite its relatively small size in the body, it clearly is, a  really powerful, powerful organ that's critical to our survival.  there are about a 100 billion neurons, but perhaps more important than the, the  number of neurons are the number of connections between these neurons, 1  quadrillion. So, million, billion, trillion,  quadrillion. so there's a lot of connections, and  that's really where the brain gets its computational power.  The neurons themselves are relatively simplistic, as you'll see, and actually  transmit information in a relatively slow way.  A common copper wire transmits information much more quickly than brain  tissue does. but what the brain has is this tightly  interconnected web of connections. 

### White Matter

White matter is usually found in the deeper tissues of the brain and contains those nerve fibers that have extensions of the nerve cell. These nerve cells have a covering around them to protect the axons, and the reason behind white colour is due to the myelin sheath that not only acts as a coating but also gives the uniqueness to such matter. It increases the speed of transmission and helps the brains move stronger whenever a minor or major injury takes place. It also comes with some basic damage precautions; mostly it happens in people at a young age and gets known as the white matter disorders. Diagnosing of this issue can be helped by MRI scans which tell about the problem and different tissue levels. The most basic caution of something not going well is that the myelin sheath is not grown properly so it does help to protect the parts of brain.  At earlier stages, people thought that it does not have any especial concern in the brain and that is why no research was done to know the exact issue. Among the two matters present in the spinal cord this one is the fastest and help in connecting others parts, so they stay in touch.

### Grey Matter

Grey Matter is defined as the major component of the human brain that has different nucleon bodies, neuropil, and some other parts that help in working on different body parts. Grey matter is more important of two matters present in brain and comes with different functions. It has become the focus of advanced research and that is why few new things are coming up. The type of fat that is present within the myelin sheath but for the grey matter, the actual colour produced from the cell structures of neurons and the brain cells that are called as glial cells. These types of cells provide energy and nutrition to the neurons, that’s how grey colour became part of the system. Most of the times it gets known as the neurons and other different cells present in the central nervous system and is part of brain, brainstem, cerebellum and inside the spinal cord.

### White matter vs Grey matter

* White matter comprises mainly  of myelinated axons, also called tracts while grey matter few myelinated axons.  
* White matter gets it light color because of  the lipid content of myelin while grey matter actually gets it grey pinkish color  from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.  
* Grey matter contains most of the neuron somas while white matter is made up mostly of myelinated axons.  
* Grey matter is made up of nerve cell bodies, and white matter is made up of fibers.  
* Neurons of white matter has extended axons while grey matter neurons don’t.  
* Grey matter occupy 40% of the brain while white matter occupies 60%  
* Gray matter reaches it highest point of development in a person furing their twenties, the white matter  develop throughout your twenties and peaks in middle age.  

### Neuron

Neurons (also called neurones or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. More than that, their interactions define who we are as people. Having said that, our roughly 100 billion neurons do interact closely with other cell types, broadly classified as glia (these may actually outnumber neurons, although it’s not really known).

Neurons send signals to other neurons via specialized contacts known as synapses. The most common type of synapse in the nervous system is known as a chemical synapse. Typically a chemical synapse occurs between the axon terminal of the neuron sending the message, and the dendrite of the neuron receiving the message. The neuron sending the message is known as the presynaptic cell and the one receiving the message is the postsynaptic cell. In a chemical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell don’t actually touch each other, but are separated by a very tiny gap known as a synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is only 20 nanometers wide. This is teeny. In comparison, a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers thick. What a chemical synapse does, is it transforms an electrical signal (which is the action potential in the presynaptic cell’s axon) into a chemical signal (which is the neurotrasmitter) and back to an electrical signal (the postsynaptic potential) in the postsynaptic cell.

### axon

An axon, or nerve fiber, is a long slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body or soma.

Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they help make up nerves.

Individual axons are microscopic in diameter - typically about one micrometre across - but may extend to macroscopic lengths.

The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spine to the big toe of each foot.

These single-cell fibers may extend a meter or even longer.

In vertebrates, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in myelin, which is formed by either of two types of glial cells: Schwann cells ensheathing peripheral neurons and oligodendrocytes insulating those of the central nervous system.

### central nervous system

The nervous system is made up of all the nerve cells in your body. It is through the nervous system that we communicate with the outside world and, at the same time, many mechanisms inside our body are controlled. The nervous system takes in information through our senses, processes the information and triggers reactions, such as making your muscles move or causing you to feel pain. For example, if you touch a hot plate, you reflexively pull back your hand and your nerves simultaneously send pain signals to your brain. Metabolic processes are also controlled by the nervous system.

There are many billions of nerve cells, also called neurons, in the nervous system. The brain alone has about 100 billion neurons in it. Each neuron has a cell body and various extensions. The shorter extensions (called dendrites) act like antennae: they receive signals from, for example, other neurons and pass them on to the cell body. The signals are then passed on via a long extension (the axon), which can be up to a meter long.

The nervous system has two parts, called the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system due to their location in the body. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It is safely contained within the skull and vertebral canal of the spine. All of the other nerves in the body are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

### peripheral nervous system

<img src="https://www.nf2is.org/nf_img/cnspns.png">

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the division of the nervous system containing all the nerves that lie outside of the central nervous system (CNS). The primary role of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the organs, limbs, and skin. These nerves extend from the central nervous system to the outermost areas of the body. The peripheral system allows the brain and spinal cord to receive and send information to other areas of the body, which allows us to react to stimuli in our environment.

The nerves that make up the peripheral nervous system are actually the axons or bundles of axons from neuron cells. In some cases, these nerves are very small but some nerve bundles are so large that they can be easily seen by the human eye.

The peripheral nervous system itself is divided into two parts:

* The somatic nervous system
* The autonomic nervous system

Each of these components plays a critical role in how the peripheral nervous system operates.  

### The Somatic Nervous System

The somatic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for carrying sensory and motor information to and from the central nervous system.


The __somatic nervous system__ derives its name from the Greek word soma, which means "body."

The __somatic system__ is responsible for transmitting sensory information as well as for voluntary movement. This system contains two major types of neurons:

* Sensory neurons (or afferent neurons) that carry information from the nerves to the central nervous system. It is these sensory neurons that allow us to take in sensory information and send it to the brain and spinal cord.   
* Motor neurons (or efferent neurons) that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to muscle fibers throughout the body. These motor neurons allow us to take physical action in response to stimuli in the environment.  

### The Autonomic Nervous System

The autonomic system is the part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for regulating involuntary body functions, such as blood flow, heartbeat, digestion, and breathing. In other words, it is the autonomic system that controls aspects of the body that are usually not under voluntary control. This system allows these functions to take place without needing to consciously think about them happening.

This system is further divided into two branches:

* The sympathetic system regulates the flight-or-fight responses. This system prepares the body to expend energy and deal with potential threats in the environment. When action is needed, the sympathetic system will trigger a response by speeding up the heart rate, increasing breathing rate, increasing blood flow to muscles, activating sweat secretion, and dilating the pupils. This allows the body to respond quickly in situations that require immediate action. In some cases, we might stay and fight the threat, while in other cases we may instead flee from the danger.  
* The parasympathetic system helps maintain normal body functions and conserve physical resources. Once a threat has passed, this system will slow the heart rate, slow breathing, reduce blood flow to muscles, and constrict the pupils. This allows us to return our bodies to a normal resting state.
