# What is Conformity?

Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in belief or behavior in order to fit in with a group.
This change is in response to real (involving the physical presence of others) or imagined (involving the pressure of social norms / expectations) group pressure.

Conformity can also be simply defined as “yielding to group pressures” (Crutchfield, 1955).  Group pressure may take different forms, for example bullying, persuasion, teasing, criticism, etc.  Conformity is also known as majority influence (or group pressure).

The term conformity is often used to indicate an agreement to the majority position, brought about either by a desire to ‘fit in’ or be liked (normative) or because of a desire to be correct (informational), or simply to conform to a social role (identification).

# Obedience and Authority

Obedience is compliance with commands given by an authority figure. In the 1960s, the social psychologist Stanley Milgram did a famous research study called the obedience study. It showed that people have a strong tendency to comply with authority figures.

#### Milgram’s Obedience Study

Milgram told his forty male volunteer research subjects that they were participating in a study about the effects of punishment on learning. He assigned each of the subjects to the role of teacher. Each subject was told that his task was to help another subject like himself learn a list of word pairs. Each time the learner made a mistake, the teacher was to give the learner an electric shock by flipping a switch. The teacher was told to increase the shock level each time the learner made a mistake, until a dangerous shock level was reached.

Throughout the course of the experiment, the experimenter firmly commanded the teachers to follow the instructions they had been given. In reality, the learner was not an experiment subject but Milgram’s accomplice, and he never actually received an electric shock. However, he pretended to be in pain when shocks were administered.

Prior to the study, forty psychiatrists that Milgram consulted told him that fewer than 1 percent of subjects would administer what they thought were dangerous shocks to the learner. However, Milgram found that two-thirds of the teachers did administer even the highest level of shock, despite believing that the learner was suffering great pain and distress. Milgram believed that the teachers had acted in this way because they were pressured to do so by an authority figure.

#### Factors That Increase Obedience

Milgram found that subjects were more likely to obey in some circumstances than others. Obedience was highest when:

* Commands were given by an authority figure rather than another volunteer  
* The experiments were done at a prestigious institution  
* The authority figure was present in the room with the subject  
* The learner was in another room  
* The subject did not see other subjects disobeying commands  

In everyday situations, people obey orders because they want to get rewards, because they want to avoid the negative consequences of disobeying, and because they believe an authority is legitimate. In more extreme situations, people obey even when they are required to violate their own values or commit crimes. Researchers think several factors cause people to carry obedience to extremes:

* People justify their behavior by assigning responsibility to the authority rather than themselves.  
* People define the behavior that’s expected of them as routine.  
* People don’t want to be rude or offend the authority.  
* People obey easy commands first and then feel compelled to obey more and more difficult commands. This process is called entrapment, and it illustrates the foot-in-the-door phenomenon.  

### Self-Serving Bias

The common human tendency to attribute one’s successes to personal characteristics, and one’s failures to factors beyond one’s control. The reason people tend to personalize success is because it helps their self-esteem levels. Most people demonstrate this behavior on a regular basis. It is human nature to take credit for things like an A on a test or a job well done at work. It is also human nature to avoid responsibility entirely for mistakes or problems.

This behavior can rob people of opportunities to learn and improve. If we address our weaknesses and listen to critique we can improve. If we avoid them and blame them on factors like the teacher, the car we took a driving test with etc, then we remain stagnant as far as skill levels.

Example: A star quarterback discusses the hard work and team-mindedness of his fellow players when asked to explain a big win. A few weeks later, after his team loses a game, the same quarterback explains that “it just wasn’t our night”.

自我服务偏向最有名的例子是把成功归因于内部因素(如能力和努力)、把失败归因于外部因素(如运气和任务难度)的倾向。
Allport (1937)把人类认知中存在的积极性探索称为“本性的最古老法则(nature’s eldest law)”—— 个体保护脆弱的自我免受现实打击的方法。
Miller和Ross (1975)把这种将成功归因为自我因素, 把失败归因为外部因素的倾向称作自我服务偏向。后来, Bradley (1978)在此基础上对这种归因偏向的系统阐述进行了扩展, 认为自我服务归因不仅对个人形象的提升起作用, 还可以提高和维持他人对自己的认识。也就是说, 这种偏向可以通过维持和提高个体的公众形象(public image), 达到保护和提升个体自尊的目的。这就解释了为什么人们有时更多地把失败而不是成功归咎于自己, 因为如果偶尔承认而非否定失败的责任, 可能会得到他人更多的喜爱。 Miller (1978)肯定了Bradley (1978)对自我服务偏向界定的贡献, 并补充认为, 对积极结果和消极结果的归因不是对因果关系认知的曲解就是对因果关系描述(description)的曲解。
Gibbs 将这种自我服务的认知曲解(distortion)进一步区分为原发性(primary)的和继发性的(secondary)。他们认为原发性曲解是指自我中心的态度和信念：自己的观点、期望、需要、权利、当前的感受和欲望非常重要, 而那些合理的观点、期望等可以不被考虑或完全忽略; 继发性曲解是指一种犯罪后的合理化：使良心、潜在的同情心以及内疚感等丧失, 这样在个体出现反社会行为后不会毁坏自我形象。

### just-world hypothesis

The just-world hypothesis or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, or order, and has high potential to result in fallacy, especially when used to rationalize people's misfortune on the grounds that they "deserve" it.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the English language in various figures of speech that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: "you got what was coming to you", "what goes around comes around", "chickens come home to roost", and "you reap what you sow". 

社会心理学上有个词汇叫做“Just-world phenomenon”(aka. Just-world hypothesis/fallacy, blaming the victims)，翻译做“公平世界假设”，也叫公平世界谬误，责怪受害者是最常见的表现。

这是一种非常常见的现象，尤其在强奸案件中，我们常常看到受害者（无论性别），总会有一些人说：“受害者穿成这样活该。”“不该喝酒。”“平时太浪荡。”诸如此类的话语。

同样的情况在之前女司机被打的事件中亦有出现，某些人特意去人肉了女司机的私生活（开房记录等）以证明这个女人不是什么好人（此处涉及男权社会常见的荡妇羞辱，不多提了），活该被打。

而在家暴案件中我们又屡屡看见指责受害者性格不好，不够善解人意等等。

### Locus of control

In personality psychology, locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's "loci" (plural of "locus", Latin for "place" or "location") are conceptualized as internal (a belief that one's life can be controlled) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which they cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).[1]

Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life derive primarily from their own actions: for example, when receiving exam results, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities. People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the exam.

Locus of control is one of the four dimensions of core self-evaluations – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem.

控制点(Locus of control)这一概念，最初是由美国社会学习理论家的朱利安·罗特(Julian Bernard Rotter)于1954年提出的一种个体归因倾向的理论，旨在对个体的归因差异进行说明和测量。罗特发现，个体对自己生活中发生的事情及其结果的控制源有不同的解释。对某些人来说，个人生活中多数事情的结果取决于个体在做这些事情时的努力程度，所以这种人相信自己能够对事情的发展与结果进行控制。此类人的控制点在个体的内部，称为内控者。对另外一些人，个体生活中多数事情的结果是个人不能控制的各种外部力量作用造成的，他们相信社会的安排，相信命运和机遇等因素决定了自己的状况，认为个人的努力无济于事。这种人倾向于放弃对自己生活的责任，他们的控制点在个体的外部，称为外控者。

由于内控者与外控者理解的控制点来源不同，因而他们对待事物的态度与行为方式也不相同。内控者相信自己能发挥作用，面对可能的失败也不怀疑未来可能会有所改善，面对困难情境，能付出更大努力，加大工作投入。他们的态度与行为方式是符合社会期待的。而外控者看不到个人努力与行为结果的积极关系，面对失败与困难，往往推卸责任于外部原因，不去寻找解决问题的办法，而是企图寻求救援或是赌博式的碰运气。他们倾向于以无助、被动的方式面对生活。显然这种态度与行为方式是不可取的。

### Stanford prison experiment

The Stanford prison experiment was a 1971 experiment that attempted to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power, focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison officers. It was conducted at Stanford University between August 14–20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students. In the study, volunteers were randomly assigned to be either "guards" or "prisoners" in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the superintendent. Two of the "prisoners" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days. The results seemed to show that the students quickly embraced their assigned roles, with some guards enforcing authoritarian measures and ultimately subjecting some prisoners to psychological torture, while many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, by the officers' request, actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it. The experiment is one of the most famous psychological experiments of all time, and is covered in most introductory social psychology textbooks.

The experiment was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research[3] as an investigation into the causes of difficulties between guards and prisoners in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. Certain portions of it were filmed, and excerpts of footage are publicly available.

Some of the experiment's findings have been called into question, and the experiment has been criticized for unethical[4][5] and unscientific practices. Critics have noted that Zimbardo instructed the "guards" to exert psychological control over the "prisoners", and that some of the participants behaved in a way that would help the study, so that, as one "guard" later put it, "the researchers would have something to work with." The experiment has also been criticized for its small sample size and unrepresentative sample population, especially given that flyers recruiting people for the experiment advertised it as dealing with "prison life". The results of the experiment have never been successfully replicated.

斯坦福监狱实验也许是整个20世纪最有名也最受争议的心理学实验。

在这项研究中，大学生们被指派在模拟监狱里扮演“囚犯”或“狱警”。实验开始不久之后，“狱警”就开始虐待“囚犯”了，这意味着外部环境会催生邪恶。这项研究的作者，斯坦福大学心理学教授菲利普·津巴多在结论中指出，如果将无辜的人放到特定环境中，给予他们超过他人的权力，这些无辜的人会开始滥用权力。而如果把人放进没有权力的环境下，他们会被迫屈服，甚至疯癫。

斯坦福监狱实验的结果多年来一直在受到仔细审查，许多人认为，比起严谨的科学，这更像是戏剧化的展示，是学术界的真人秀。（何况，这个实验进行到一半就中断了。）现在，这一新的曝光又激起千层浪：抛开其中的欺骗成分不谈，这也足以让实验原本的结论变得无效。它不再能证明权力位置本身可以导致残忍，而是表明权威人士如果想要残忍行为，可以说服别人听从他。

“底线是：服从并不是天然的、盲目的、无可避免的。”社会心理学家杰·巴维尔（Jay Van Bavel）发推说。“津巴多不但把这一点搞错了，而且他的公开言论还误导了成百上千万人。”

“我们必须停止颂扬这项研究了。”人格心理学家辛明·瓦沙（Simine Vazire）发推表示，“这完全是反科学的，把它从教科书里删除吧。”

很多其他心理学家也表达了类似观点。

### bystander effect

The term bystander effect refers to the phenomenon in which the greater the number of people present, the less likely people are to help a person in distress. When an emergency situation occurs, observers are more likely to take action if there are few or no other witnesses. Being part of a large crowd makes it so no single person has to take responsibility for an action (or inaction).

旁观者效应也称为责任分散效应，是指对某一件事来说，如果是单个个体被要求单独完成任务，责任感就会很强，会作出积极的反应。但如果是要求一个群体共同完成任务，群体中的每个个体的责任感就会很弱，面对困难或遇到责任往往会退缩。因为前者独立承担责任，后者期望别人多承担点儿责任。“责任分散”的实质就是人多不负责，责任不落实。

### Diffusion of responsibility

Diffusion of responsibility is a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when others are present. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so. Assumption of responsibility tends to decrease when the potential helping group is larger, resulting in little aiding behavior demonstrated by the bystander(s). Causes range from psychological effects of anonymity to differences in gender. Implication of behaviors related to diffusion of responsibility can be threatening as there have been increases in moral disengagement and helping behavior. The infamous rape case of Kitty Genovese and increased murders in WWII can be attributed to diffusion of responsibility.

责任分散效应（Diffusion of responsibility）也称为旁观者效应，是指对某一件事来说，如果是单个个体被要求单独完成任务，责任感就会很强，会作出积极的反应。

但如果是要求一个群体共同完成任务，群体中的每个个体的责任感就会很弱，面对困难或遇到责任往往会退缩.

对于责任分散效应形成的原因，心理学家进行了大量的实验和调查，结果发现这种现象不能仅仅说是众人的冷酷无情，或道德日益沦丧的表现。因为在不同的场合，人们的援助行为确实是不同的。当一个人遇到紧急情境时，如果只有他一个人能提供帮助，他会清醒地意识到自己的责任，对受难者给予帮助。如果他见死不救会产生罪恶感、内疚感，这需要付出很高的心理代价。而如果有许多人在场的话，帮助求助者的责任就由大家来分担，造成责任分散，每个人分担的责任很少，旁观者甚至可能连他自己的那一份责任也意识不到，从而产生一种"我不去救，由别人去救"的心理，造成"集体冷漠"的局面。如何打破这种局面，这是心理学家正在研究的一个重要课题。

### Realistic conflict theory

Realistic conflict theory (initialized RCT), also known as realistic group conflict theory (initialized RGCT), is a social psychological model of intergroup conflict. The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of prejudice and discrimination toward the outgroup that accompany the intergroup hostility. Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived scarcity of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status.

Feelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a zero-sums fate, in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the "winning" group achieving the limited resource first). The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource. According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if superordinate goals are in place.

现实群体冲突理论，解释偏见的理论。这个理论认为，在现实生活中，像产品、工作、金钱和地位等常常因不够分配或分配不合理而不能使每个人满意。当人们过多追求自己需要的满足时，人与人之间、群体之间往往会为取得更多有价值的东西而发生竞争，甚至产生偏见、冲突。这一理论认为，在群体间竞争中， 人们对对手的评价会越来越坏，他们互相把对方看作“敌人”，认为自己组的成员一切都正确、合理，开始仅仅是竞争，后来会导致根深蒂固的偏见或冲突。 

谢里夫及其同事早期所进行的“群体间冲突的合作”实验曾发现，小组间的冲突会加强团体内的合作，并会引起对外团体的敌视。布莱克和穆顿研究了一些在竞争小组中工作的经理，发现他们很快都对对方作出极坏的评价。但这种冲突在一定条件下，如创设一种使各群体只有通过合作才能实现更大目标的情境，加强沟通等，也可得到消除。
